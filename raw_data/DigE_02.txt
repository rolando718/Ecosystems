AB A novel optimisation technique inspired by natural ecosystems is presented, where the optimisation works at two levels: a first optimisation, migration of services which are distributed in a decentralised peer-to-peer network, operating continuously in time; this process feeds a second optimisation based on evolutionary computing that operates locally on single peers and is aimed at finding solutions to satisfy locally relevant constraints. Through this twofold process, the local search is accelerated and will yield better local optima, because the distributed optimisation already provides a good sampling of the search space by making use of computations already performed in other peers with similar constraints. We call this new distributed optimisation architecture a Digital Ecosystem, an Ecosystem-Orientated Architecture (EOA) created by extending a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) with Distributed Evolutionary Computing (DEC). The Digital Ecosystem will allow services to recombine and evolve over time, constantly seeking to improve their effectiveness for the user base. Individuals within our Digital Ecosystem will be applications (groups of services), created in response to user requests by using evolutionary optimisation to aggregate the services. These individuals will migrate through the Digital Ecosystem and adapt to find niches where they are useful in fulfilling other user requests.

AB Adaptation to changing requirements is one of the predominant challenges in distributed development. Software projects exceeding certain scales cannot be addressed by small-sized companies because of the incapability of meeting the financial guarantees and also because of staffing problems. In spite of their advantage of being more flexible, small companies when teaming up are usually overextended due to the overhead of communication and synchronization costs. A need emerges here for an infrastructure endorsing decomposability of software specifications and semi-automatic re-composition of the implemented components to satisfy the original requirements. This infrastructure facilitates a more efficient risk management due to the more finely grained specification. Such an infrastructure is presented here as a result of an ongoing research and implementation activity including real-world testing spanning several European countries and regions.

AB Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is an effective tool for data analysis and knowledge discovery. Concept lattice, which is derived from mathematical order theory and lattice theory is the core of FCA. Man); research works of various areas show that concept lattices structures is an effective platform for data mining, machine learning, information retrieval, software engineer etc. This paper offers a brief overview of FCA and proposes to apply FCA as a tool for analysis and visualization of data in Digital ecosystem, and also discusses the applications of data mining for Digital ecosystem.

Within FP6 IST several interesting and important domains were focused, e.g. interoperabilitiy Ebusiness digital ecosystem or ambient intelligence technologies. Within these domains we present in this paper three European projects solving innovative problems emerged mainly in B2B area and support knowledge transfer into NMS.

AB This work approaches the problem of the lack of competence, certainty in the reciprocal trading and awareness of regulatory issues for Small and Medium Enterprises that cooperate to dynamically exchange resources, applications, services and knowledge in an e-business context. It is presented the approach adopted in the DBE project(1), in which it is fundamental to promote and boost trust relations between the DBE-adopters and the potential ones, supporting the creation of services and transactions that will occur respecting local regulatory requirement. In this paper we will show how we addresses the previous requirements to design a legal architecture for digital ecosystems, model the knowledge related to contracts, agreement and regulatory issues, grant effectiveness to the general model by designing and implementing a process for the capture, modification and extension of this knowledge.

AB The knowledge-based networked business ecosystem represents geographical (or virtual) area where specific policy initiatives foster growth and improve innovation, productivity and social aspects through the optimal use local assets empowered by information and communication systems (ICT). Effective human interaction with ICT within such a digital ecosystem depends on the access methods, suitability and form of content and knowledge sharing. A network of digital ecosystems, as public common resource, offers to SMEs and to less developed areas opportunities of participation in the global economy.

AB Artificial life simulations represent an opportunity to study adaptation phenomena observed in living organisms. One such phenomenon is reverse evolution, which has been observed in microbes and some sexual populations. This paper shows how populations of digital organisms achieve reverse evolution using a genetic algorithm approach. Patterns of reverse evolution analysed among a number of phenotypic characters provide an insight into the complexity of this evolutionary process. Similarly this type of approaches may assist the modelling of evolutionary processes, whose outcomes would require many years to be tested on a natural environment.

AB An artificial life entertainment-software product called Creatures was released in Europe in late 1996 and in the United States and Japan in mid-1997. When installed on a domestic computer (PC or Macintosh), each Creatures CD-ROM creates a virtual world in which autonomous software agents exist. The agents, known as "norns," interact with the human user, with each other, and with objects in their virtual world. Each norn coordinates perception and action via its own modular recurrent neural network: Each network has Hebbian learning, plus diffuse modulation of activity via a "hormonal" system that is part of that norn's "biochemistry." Details of each norn's neural network and biochemistry are genetically specified, and norns can breed via sexual reproduction. In the reproduction process, genetic material may be mutated and may also be subjected to "gene duplications" that enable potentially unlimited increases in complexity of the norns' design. Over 500,000 Creatures CD-ROMS have now been sold. As each installed copy of Creatures can support 5 to 10 simultaneously existing individual norns, it seems reasonable to estimate that there are up to 5 million norns existing in the "cyberspace" provided by the global Creatures user community. Continued growth of the global norn population, to figures measured in tens of millions, is quite likely. Although a commercial product, the Creatures digital ecosystem should be of interest to artificial life scientists: There are obvious parallels with Yaeger's PolyWorld and Ray's NetTierra systems. This article provides a detailed discussion of the links between the artificial life literature and the technology used in Creatures and includes anecdotal discussion of the "digital naturalism" witnessed on the many independent websites maintained by Creatures enthusiasts.
