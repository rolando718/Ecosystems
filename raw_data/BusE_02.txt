AB This paper examines the adoption dynamics of increasing-return technologies in a systemic business ecosystem context. Many systemic, complex technologies have shown to exhibit increasing returns to adoption in that the initial increase in adoption leads to increasing experience with the technology and improvements in technology and its utilization which further lead to increasing adoption. In systemic context our empirical study examines the adoption dynamics of technology utilization provisioned by another sub-system industry's actors. We hypothesize that the more a technology is utilized initially the faster the adoption would be due to experience gained in utilizing technology. Simultaneously, we hypothesize that as the technologies become more complex as they build on existing knowledge, the dynamics of adoption would slow down since the experience accumulation becomes more difficult and resource consuming. Our original empirical setting considers some 2890 products utilizing 54 different technologies and platforms in the computer industry. Our modeling results show that, technological improvements between successive technologies influences the companies' adoption of the successive technology in a way that the more there is improvement performance-wise, the less the firms adopt the technology. However, we also find some anomalies contrary to our initial expectations and discuss the managerial and research implications.

AB Objective The field of ambient assisted living (AAL) is attracting increasing attention from policymakers, industry and the general public. The reason is the growing number of elderly persons and the opportunities provided by new technological advances. The objective of MonAMI (Mainstreaming on Ambient Intelligence) is to demonstrate that accessible and useful services for elderly and disabled persons at home can be delivered on a mainstream, open-standard, flexible platform. A number of issues related to the market, exploitation, policies and business opportunities are also being addressed.
   Main content The technology base for delivering the MonAMI services is the MonAMI platform developed from mainstream, open-source components in an OSGi framework with a touch screen computer as the central element. Other parts are a Universal Control Hub as the user interfaces server, wireless sensor networks and a remote service management function. The total is a platform flexible enough to deliver a wide range of different services and facilitate future development and addition of services in a cost-effective manner. The services developed have been grouped into five packages: AMiSURE for safety and security, AMiCASA for home control, AMiVUE for home status information, AMiPAL for time management and AMiPLAY for games. The technology and the services have been installed and evaluated in the homes of 62 users in Slovakia, Spain and Sweden.
   Results The field trial ran for three months ending in March 2011. The evaluation covers the benefit to the users as well as operational parameters, reliability and scalability.
   Conclusions MonAMI has provided a proof of concept of the benefit and feasibility of AAL services over a home platform. The challenge now is to create a mainstream market for AAL applications, i.e. an ecosystem that provides economic opportunities while addressing the social necessity of our ageing society. MonAMI has identified a three-phase roadmap to that end.

AB Nowadays, many scholars and mangers focus on dynamic capability, which is defined as "the firm's ability to integrate, build, and reconfigure internal and external competences to address rapidly changing environments". Although there are many research results, they pay little close attention to publishing enterprises. Considering of the particularity of the publishing enterprises, in this paper, we discuss its identification and construction from the perspective of business ecosystem.

AB In the field of digital business environment/ecosystem, the self-regulation feature plays crucial role. ICT support biological and sociological phenomena through efficient electronic services. One of the main roles is building and enhancing efficient relationships between actors within the ecosystem. Problem of interaction between commercial subjects depends on expected benefits/utility. These expectations are predictors of successful result from realized transaction with potential partner. And this predictor is based on trust and trustworthiness. The paper presents trust as crucial factor for cooperation and discusses specifics of trust building mechanisms in e-cooperation within digital business ecosystem. Together, it is discussed synergy effects between several trust building mechanisms.

ID BALANCED SCORECARD
AB Implementation of different B2B networks and digital business ecosystems improved the efficiency of business processes in terms of collaboration, communication and knowledge flow. In addition to these effects, B2B networking provides the data which was not available till now - ICT-based networks aggregate the data describing the companies business behaviour in inter-organizational relationships. Such new behavioural business market statistics can be used for several analyses in order to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of business and network processes, as companies are now able to compare with other companies and the data describing the whole network is available. In this paper, two concepts of such analyses - benchmark and network performance assessment - are proposed. Both concepts are based on data related to procurement procedure of companies. First proposed concept - benchmark indicator - assesses, whether procurement procedure is conducted in proper way concerning supplier's competition aspect. Second proposed concept - network performance indicator assesses, whether the network supply is adequate to network demand.

AB The authors offer a synthetic overview of some publicly funded organisations involved in actions of Research and Development (R&D) and Technology Transfer (TT) in Italy and, in particular, in the Southern areas. Some judgements have been formulated basing on several Stakeholders' opinions, crucial factors have been identified in the Italian TT experiences. The work illustrates a case of success in the ICT sector: the Pole in L&K, based in the Province of Salerno. This experience, was born within a department of the University of Salerno from the intuition of a Leader and a Team of young researchers, has conveyed into the creation of a non profit, public/private Consortium (CRMPA), which has lived the phases of a SME, characterised as an oscillating system: from the Entrepreneurial Model, to a model centred on Corporate Technology Assets. A participattory model spin-off, has been implemented, giving birth to other Consortia, and the CRMPA has evolved into a network structure over the National territory. The current phase presents a virtual organisation whose core is composed of the Embryo group and some spin-off structures, and the permanent halo strictly connected to the core. The model is inspired to the SMEs lifecycle to create an ITC Business Ecosystem in Central Southern Italy. The work ends with some considerations about the desirability to use the Cases of Success model to implement TT actions, supported by both politics and concessional financing, able to improve the the competitiveness National Economic System.

AB With the increasing popularity of the service-oriented thinking in the business area, an overwhelming number of business services have arisen. These business services collaborate with each other and form a business network or a service-oriented business ecosystem (SOBE). It is a key issue to select appropriate business services to share and integrate them in the SOBE. Trust degrees play an important role in the selection of business services. However, existing researches mainly focus on quality of service (QoS)-based selection methods and few of them take trust degrees into account. In order to select services more accurately, a trust-based approach for selection of business services is proposed based on the formal definition of the SOBE. First, the method for acquisition and calculation of trust values is developed. The method also considers other parameters including QoS attributes, the physical distance between users and business services and the waiting time. Second, one node in a business flow may need to select two or more business services to achieve the user's requirements. Thus, the multi-service selection method for one node is presented. Third, a fuzzy chance-constrained programming model is proposed for the selection of business services by considering four kinds of factors: QoS attributes, trust relationship, physical distance and waiting time. Using the characteristic of fuzzy constraints, a function is developed to convert the fuzzy chance constraints into its crisp equivalents and then the equivalent crisp model is solved by the generic algorithm (GA)-based algorithm. For the case in which no satisfying solution can be found by the GA-based algorithm, a negotiation method is proposed to reach at a satisfying solution. Finally, a case study is conducted to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB The industry convergence of mobile networks and the Internet produces the mobile Internet. The form of mobile Internet competition has changed, which is no long er a competition between individual enterprises, but a competition between the business ecosystems. This paper builds the competitive advantage model of mobile Internet ecosystem based on the user needs. Then we, using this model, analyze the three major mobile Internet ecosystems: terminal operators, service providers and network operators. We also believe that value innovation is the specific means to achieve system competitive advantage. At last we build a set of evaluation index system of system competitive advantage, and evaluate the three major ecosystems.

AB Recent dramatic changes in a mobile industry, initiated by smart phones, are drawing enormous attention to business ecosystems. A perspective to view firms as members of cross-industry ecosystem was first suggested by Moore [1] for describing co-evolution behavior in high-technology business areas. Although an ecosystem has been pervasive in any industry at any time, today's eco-systems are getting more horizontal and complex. This study develops a representation model of such complex ecosystems and a framework for analyzing interrelated productivity of ecosystem members. The proposed model especially emphasizes interdependency between product and service offerings that ecosystem members cooperatively deliver. This interdependency determines the interrelation between members' productivity, and finally sustainability of a whole ecosystem. This study describes a general procedure for representing and analyzing an ecosystem and discusses the difference between the traditional and smart phone mobile ecosystems based on the result of the analysis.

AB Within a Collaborative Business Ecosystem context, as the network evolves, the competition between members increases and, as a consequence, members face the challenge to improve the chances their services have to be selected. On the other hand, the distance between Business Services and "Computational Services" is still a bottleneck for the automation of service provision. This paper extends the Pro-Active Service Entity Framework, proposing a mechanism to improve the service selection chances, based on the refinement of a Quality of Service concept for this context, and introduces a new class of actors for the framework the intermediaries, needed to shorten the distance between Business and Computational perspectives.

AB This article addresses the role of trust and regulation where small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the European Union (EU) make use of e-business in a digital business ecosystem (DBE). We argue that in order for digital business to develop among entrepreneurs in the EU and within different industry sectors and geographical locations, trust and regulation are of critical importance. The article assesses the importance of this argument and focuses on the interplay of regulatory and trust-based issues that need to be accommodated before one can expect SMEs to engage in e-business supported within a DBE environment. It then presents a taxonomy that addresses key regulatory issues and fosters trust. The article proposes the taxonomy as the vehicle for the simplification of a bewildering array of laws, standards, norms and expectations, as well as for the elimination of regulatory overlap and conflict. The contribution of the taxonomy is demonstrated in the last section of the article, where it is empirically tested and applied to SMEs which participated in the EU-funded DBE project.

AB The success of an innovating firm often depends on the efforts of other innovators in its environment. How do the challenges faced by external innovators affect the focal firm's outcomes? To address this question we first characterize the external environment according to the structure Of interdependence. We follow the flow of inputs and outputs in the ecosystem to distinguish between upstream components that tire handled by the focal firm, and downstream complements that are bundled by the firm's customers. We hypothesize that the effects of external innovation challenges depend not only on their magnitude, but also 017 their location in the ecosystem relative to the focal firm. We identify a key asymmetry that results from the location of challenges relative to a focal firm-greater upstream innovation challenges in components enhance the benefits that accrue to technology leaders, while greater downstream innovation challenges in complements erode these benefits. We,further propose that the effectiveness of vertical integration as a strategy to manage ecosystem interdependence increases over the course of the technology life cycle. Me explore these arguments in the context of the global semiconductor lithography equipment industry from its emergence in 1962 to 2005 across nine distinct technology generations. We find strong empirical support for our framework. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Digital Ecosystems (DEST) have emerged with the purpose of enhancing communications among small and medium enterprises (SMEs) within the worldwide Business Ecosystem. However, because of the diversity and heterogeneity of the services in the DEST environment, existing commercial products or research outputs cannot be directly applied to this field so as to fulfill the requirements of SMEs. Human-centered computing has been applied to many areas, such as social classification, community-based ontology evolution, and more importantly, human-centered systems. In this paper, we propose a framework for a human-centered semantic service platform, in order to address the issue in the DEST environment. This framework incorporates the features of human-centered metadata publishing, maintenance and clustering, community-based ontology revolution and human-centered service retrieval, evaluation and ranking. To thoroughly validate the framework, we implement a prototype in the transport service domain, and conduct a series of evaluation experiments on the basis of this prototype.

AB The paper considers the complex behavior of a small company in a business ecosystem, time by time leader or supplier or both in one or more supply chains, and points out the data exchange and processing problems it must face for reacting fast to customer requests. Then the paper suggests that in order to meet these requirements it is convenient to provide every company with proper automatic functions, covering its distributed planning, resource scheduling and exception handling needs, whose policies can be fully customised by the company itself to mirror its specific intentions: in short, a practical implementation of the autonomic model.

DE business ecosystem; enterprise information systems; SME
AB Today's businesses form a highly interconnected network of companies, organisations, technologies, consumers, products and services. The concept of the Digital Business Ecosystem (DBE) has been come life in order to build an Internet-based environment in which businesses will be able to interact with each other more efficiently. In a Digital Ecosystem, a leadership structure is formed in order to be capable of responding to the dynamic needs of the environment. The agent in a Digital Ecosystem can both be a client and a server at the same time. With the same message, agents can simultaneously offer a service to others as a Server and request help as a Client. Industries may have their own systems but they are not yet business ecosystems. Digital ecosystems rely on a technological infrastructure to mediate the formalisation of knowledge in SME networks, the creation of software services, and different type of interactions between SMEs. There are many fields of application in the agro-food industry where interoperability of information system would be essential. Amongst others food tracking and tracing, logistics, SRM and CRM integration all need interoperability solution in a heterogeneous environment. Our prototypes can help in building these cooperative information systems.

AB Online applications such as games and e-learning applications fall within the broader category of real-time online interactive applications (ROIA), a new class of 'killer' application for the Grid that is being investigated in the edutain@grid project. The two case studies in edutain@grid are an online game and an e-learning training application. We present a novel Grid-based business framework that makes use of bipartite service level agreements (SLAs) and dynamic invoice models to model complex business relationships in a massively scalable and flexible way. We support cross-organization load management at the business level, through zone migration. For evaluation we look at existing and extended value chains, the quality of service (QoS) metrics measured and the dynamic invoice models that support this work. We examine the causal links from customer quality of experience (QoE) and service provider quality of business (QoBiz) through to measured quality of service. Finally we discuss a shared reward business ecosystem and suggest how extended service level agreements and invoice models can support this.

AB Climate change is often considered in terms of its macroscale implications. For example, many governments and non-governmental organizations are engaged in the development of policy frameworks that could influence different societal actions and behavioral scenarios. But such macroscale policy decisions may also significantly impact the localized design of products and services in different business ecosystems. Unfortunately, products and services are generally designed only taking into account local influences. An approach that ties macroscale frameworks to localized product- or system-level design metrics is lacking. For example, the cost of upgrading the entire U.S. electrical system has been estimated to be on the order of $200 billion, and recent U.S. policy discussions in the area outline options such as "smart" grid upgrades, distributed and/or on-site renewable energy systems including solar and wind energy, infrastructural support for plug-in of electric and hybrid vehicles etc. But most existing electricity generation and thermal performance models of power generating stations or cogeneration plants fail to provide any indication of the environmental impacts associated with distributing electricity from generator to point-of-use. It is thus not intuitive how the direction of localized plant or system design should be altered given the different macro-level initiatives.
   This paper attempts to fill this gap by exploring a methodology that combines engineering economics, probabilistic risk assessment, and thermodynamic (2(nd) Law) analysis to evaluate different policy choices. Specifically, a framework that could allow quick estimation of the comparative consumption, operational power requirements, relative thermal performance and environmental footprint associated with different proposals on upgrading the grid is developed. The approach is demonstrated in the context of a representative segment of a hypothetical electrical grid distribution system located between two electric power generating stations (EPGS) facing overload as additional customer demands are projected to be integrated with renewable sources in the near-term future.

TI Probabilistic thermoeconomic risk assessment for evaluating climate
   change decisions
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GLOBAL WARMING
LA English
DT Article
DE policy; risk assessment; thermodynamics; economics
AB Climate change is often considered in terms of its macroscale implications. But macroscale policy decisions may also significantly impact the localised design of products and services in different business ecosystems. This paper addresses this disconnect by exploring a methodology that combines engineering economics, probabilistic risk assessment, and thermodynamic analysis to evaluate different policy choices. The approach is demonstrated in the context of a representative segment of a hypothetical electrical grid distribution system located between two Electric Power Generating Stations (EPGS) facing overload as additional customer demands are projected to be integrated with renewable sources in the near-term future.

AB The Digital Business Ecosystem (DBE) is an organizational approach which allows competitive enterprises to cooperate with each other. It is necessary to put aside the operating realizations to follualize this new approach in order to build up a theory to base the empirical experimentation. This work is a contribution to the formalization with the goal of understanding how competitive enterprises with heterogeneous organizations and belonging to different areas, can coexist in a same DBE. The formalization proposed has a logical reading based on processes models. Thanks to the use of the process models it is possible to organize some tools which allow to quickly build platforms for DBE management and governance and to make this flexible to comply with the different operating modes foreseen by the management of the enterprises which are part of the DBE.

AB This article is based on business niche form to conduct the research on optimized method of exhibition enterprises' competitive cooperation relationship. According to current condition of exhibition industry's overlap relations, via optimal evaluation model, the article constructs route for optimizing exhibition enterprises' competitive cooperation relationship from 4 aspects, i. e niche expansion, separation, consolidation and symbiosis. Exhibition enterprises need to cut down the low-efficient index of business niche; to maintain and consolidate the advanced business niche index; to adjust constantly until to reach a real firm business niche. Optimized relations of exhibition enterprises will be a benign competitive cooperation status to complete supply chain of upstream and downstream then get a systemic competitiveness.

AB Digital Ecosystem is an innovative high-tech environment with the purpose of supporting the activities among species within the business ecosystem. In this paper, we concern about the research issue of service retrieval within such an environment. Due to the fact that species are heterogeneous and geographically dispersed, to precisely and quickly locate a service provider becomes an issue. In addition, the Digital Ecosystem environment urgently requires the structualization of service information and a set of unified QoS measurement for service ranking and evaluation. In order to unfold the issues in detail, we use the means of case study and literature survey. Eventually we formulate the research issues in this domain and provide a possible solution.

AB The Digital Business Ecosystem (DBE) is the result of the co-evolution of the Business Ecosystem and the Digital Ecosystem. There are numerous approaches and enabling technologies which are used in modeling open business marketplaces and, due to the similarities between the Digital Business environments, they can also help to enable the Digital Business Ecosystem but with some limitations. The complete lifecycle of the DBE can be decomposed into the following phases: formation, evolution and dissipation. In this work, our main focus is on the importance of negotiation in the DBE formation phase and especially on the structure of Contract Net Protocol. We will present an extension to the primitive Contract Net Protocol and name it Contract Net with Quality Protocol (CNQP or Q-Contract Net) to facilitate the negotiation process by adding the quality evaluation steps during the negotiation phase of the DBE formation.

By continually trying to improve the health of its ecosystem, Amazon ensures its own survival and prosperity The mechanisms through which Amazon has created its ecosystem are discussed and ideas for firms looking to create analogous business communities are advanced.

AB We present a Peer-to-Peer network design which aims to support business activities conducted through a network of collaborations that generate value in different, mutually beneficial, ways for the participating organisations. The temporary virtual networks formed by long-term business transactions that involve the execution of multiple services from different providers are used as the building block of the underlying scale-free business network. We show how these local interactions, which are not governed by a single organisation, give rise to a fully distributed P2P architecture that reflects the dynamics of business activities. The design is based on dynamically formed permanent clusters of nodes, the so-called Virtual Super Peers (VSPs), and this results in a topology that is highly resilient to certain types of failure (and attacks). Furthermore, the proposed P2P architecture is capable of reconfiguring itself to adapt to the usage that is being made of it and respond to global failures of conceptual hubs. This fosters an environment where business communities can evolve to meet emerging business opportunities and achieve sustainable growth within a digital ecosystem.

AB We propose a methodology with which one can model the interactions of agents in a digital business ecosystem. We assume that the system is closed and static and define a global cost function that may be used to identify the states of the system. The cost function is minimized with the help of the Langevin equation. We demonstrate the use of the proposed model with the help of simulated data.

AB In multi-agent systems, the underlying networks are always dynamic and network topologies are always changing over time. Performance analyses of topologies are important for understanding the robustness of the system and also the effects of topology on the system efficiency and effectiveness. In this paper, we present all example of a real-world distributed agent system, a digital business ecosystem (DBE). It is modelled as a two coupled network system. The tipper layer is the business network layer where business process between different business agents happen. The lower layer is the underlying P2P communication layer to support communications between the agents. Algorithms for multi-agent tasks negotiation and execution, interaction between agents and the underlying communication network, evolutionary network topology dynamics, are provided. These algorithms consider the two network layers evolving over time, with effects on each other. Through a comprehensive set of discrete event simulation, we investigate the effects of different evolutionary principles inspired by random graph and scale-free network it) complex network theory oil the topological properties and performance of the underlying network. We also find several roles to design a resilient and efficient P2P network. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Analyzing a business ecosystem is not an easy task, and therefore only a few studies have been made, even though some scholars and managers accept this concept from ecology since value creation is achieved by establishing a platform that other members of the ecosystem can use to enhance their performance. This paper presents a case study based on both qualitative and quantitative data, by explaining how Cisco Systems has been so successful in utilizing its strategy of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) for corporate growth based on a business ecosystem, especially from a technological perspective. We use US patent data from 1993 to 2005 to illustrate Cisco's technological roadmap. Finally, implications of symbiosis, platform, and co-evolution are provided for managers to challenge the contemporary business environment. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Instead of the currently prevailing competitive model, a more collaborative strategy is needed to address the concerns related to the unsustainability of today's business. This article aims to explore collaborative approaches where enterprises seek to build long-term, mutually beneficial relationships with all stakeholders and want to produce sustainable values for their whole business ecosystem. Cases here analyzed demonstrate that alternative ways of doing business are possible. These enterprises share more democratic ownership structures, more balanced and broader governance systems, and a more comprehensive view of organizational goals and performance - which goes beyond the narrow concept of financial bottom line and into a stronger and systematic care of the needs and requirements of the different stakeholder groups. Thanks to this evidence and different theoretical and empirical contributions, we suggest that the strength and sustainability of enterprises come from their ability to fit into the environmental, social, and cultural context in which they operate. By creating values for all stakeholders, enterprises can involve them and gain deep support based on their commitment. This may lead to superior performance from a multiple-bottom-line perspective.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB Enterprise Architecture deals with the structure of an enterprise, relationships and interactions of its units. It provides a holistic approach to reconcile IT and Business concerns in an enterprise. Virtual Enterprises are collaborative ad-hoc alliances of multiple enterprises for a specific business opportunity. This paper looks into both the paradigms and Enterprise Architecture viewpoint of Virtual Enterprise. Service Oriented Architecture as a style of Enterprise Architecture proves to be an enabler of Virtual Enterprises at Business and Technology Levels. The three major challenges with Virtual Enterprise are flexibility, adaptability, and agility. This paper discusses Virtual Enterprise Architecture as a solution to these challenges, surveys research into formal models of Virtual Enterprise Architecture and identifies current gaps in this research.

AB The business digital ecosystem is based on autonomous proactive agents that act for their own advantage. This paper uses the ecosystem paradigm to develop a novel view of the behaviour of a demand network using a packet switching model of intelligent products. Products may have local intelligence and allocation of products to nodes in the demand network is based on optimal return for all parties using dynamic information.

AB Organizational learning, knowledge generation, capture, sharing and application are important activities in today's rapidly changing and hyper-competitive business ecosystem. The demand of continuing education in SME's is raised by accelerated tempo of the modern lifestyle and rapid technological changes. Continuing education, effective use of information and communication technologies (ICT) and knowledge Management (KM) are effective instruments for small and medium enterprises (SME) to become and remain competitive. This paper provides a conceptual model for continuous education development in SME's by using knowledge management methods and creating an IT supported ecosytem. The paper demonstrates an enterprise modeling (EM) method that incorporates IT technologies to identify users' needs and match them to appropriate learning curricula to suit their needs and interests. This conceptual model is context and technology adapatable and supports formal and informal learning scenariois. The ecosystems approach more precisely matches users' demonstrated skills levels to learning options mere precisely than those available to them with IT technologies.

AB The process of business negotiations of complex products or services is an essential binding element in today's dynamic global markets. The Digital Business Ecosystem (DBE) paradigm provides a concept for understanding such dynamic global businesses. However, an analysis form a business model perspective is still missing. This paper presents the case study of an envisioned Open Source decentralized negotiation platform which is currently under development. In contrast to existing negotiation platforms such as Ebay in the B2C market or Ariba in the B2B market, the negotiation platform is based on a decentralized philosophy both on technical and organizational level following the DBE paradigm. The analysis is structure along seven major components according to the MCM Business Model Framework: features of the specific product or service, features for the specific medium (technology), potential customers, value chain, financial flow, flow of goods and services, societal environment. As a result, we categorize the characteristics and challenges in the different business model components providing the foundation to analyze further business ecosystems from a business model perspective.

AB Most governments, industries and institutions face an adaptive challenge to a changed context for strategy. The new operating environment is characterized by complexity, interactivity, and rapid evolution. It produces more challenges than any one person, business, or government can respond to effectively. This has two implications. The first is the importance of building collaboration that spans industry environments, spawns novel partnerships, and involves multiple stakeholders. The second is the importance of shaping developments proactively around a new theory for growth.
   The idea for ecosystems as a business metaphor was introduced in the mid-1990s, drawing on biology as a new language and logic for strategy. At the time, it was considered a fundamental shift that reframed the cutting edge for thinking about leadership and competition across a broad arc of potential settings, from airlines to restaurants. While the information technology industry is adopting a vision of digital ecosystems as a guide for technological evolution, a wider embrace of business ecosystems as opportunity space for new markets and competitive advantage has stalled.
   This paper provides context to close an implementation gap between technology innovation and ecosystem-centered business strategy, and introduces an ecosystem approach to create a self-generating market in the pharmaceutical industry. It also suggests a convulsing international system reveals the deeper structural transformation reshaping the human condition, creating new commercial pressure that will force leaders in industry and government to reorient their thinking in order to escape the Darwinian reaper.

AB Virtual Enterprises (VEs) bring together expertise and processes of different companies to react to a market opportunity. Here we propose a novel approach to support the collaborative construction and evolution of such VEs and their business processes, comprising a model of the VE, and a set of model construction rules and operators. Our approach is based on the principles of iterative elaboration, devolved decision-making and situatedness, and achieves flexibility by treating the processes of work, coordination and selection in a uniform manner. We argue that certain assumptions behind existing approaches make them unsuitable to the business practices we observed in the target business ecosystem. We then show how the proposed approach call underpin software Support for informal business practices of collaborative process construction by manufacturing SMEs.

AB It is widely acknowledged that increasing collaboration among organizations is one of the most important characteristics in the knowledge economy. A network of digital business ecosystems, which results from the structurally coupled and co-evolving digital ecosystem and business ecosystem, will offer opportunities of participation in the global economy to enterprises and to less developed or remote areas([1]). However, digital business ecosystem is a relatively new concept in the field of e-business research, and there is still a lot of work to be done to establish its theoretical framework. Therefore, this paper reviews the theoretical relevance and discusses the co-evolution of digital business ecosystem in theoretical and modeling perspectives. First, the concept is brought out by discussing views of main contributors. Second, a two-layer co-evolutionary framework is established in the digital business ecosystem. Finally, a Logistic model is used to analysis the value creation produced in this ecosystem when individual organization co-evolved with other organizations.

AB The disruption of supply chain can cause serious result for firms, which has been studied over the years. A sound supply network is essential for a company to avoid the tragedy. Industrial clusters provide a business ecosystem for firms, where there are relatively rich resources of the supply chains, innovation companies, and skill pools, and firms can take the advantages of the clusters' resource to build his own supply networks. Applying supply networks to business practice based on the industrial clusters is an innovative solution in the supply chain management practice.

AB As SMEs conduct more and more of their business through collaborations and networks, the key focus in ICT is shifting from the individual enterprise to the supply chains of which they are a part, and to the wider 'business ecosystem'. Just as we can only get a proper understanding of nature by considering each of the species as part of an ecosystem, so we can only get a proper view of local economies by considering them as communities of interacting and evolving organizations. This insight calls for a new approach to ICT infrastructure: one that enables businesses of all sizes, and especially SMEs, to develop, adapt and use innovative applications and services quickly and easily so as to compete in the fast-moving global economy.

AB To execute a complex business task, business entities may need to collaborate with each other as individually they may not have the capability or willingness to perform the task on its own. Such collaboration can be seen implemented in digital business ecosystems in the form of simple coalitions using multi-agent systems or by employing Electronic Institutions. A major challenge is choosing optimal partners who will deliver the agreed commitments, and act in the coalition's interest. Business entities are scaled according to their quality level. Determining the quality of previously unknown business entities and predicting the quality of such an entity in a dynamic environment are crucial issues in Business Ecosystems. A comprehensive quality management system grounded in the concepts of Trust and Reputation can help address these issues.

SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS & INDUSTRIAL MARKETING

DT Article
DE Relationship marketing; Buyer-seller relationships; Ecology; Networking
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose and elaborate on a service-dominant-logic-based conceptualization of relationship that transcends traditional conceptualizations.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper consists of a review of traditional conceptualizations of relationship, a review of service-dominant logic foundational premises that are useful in reframing the concept, and supporting views from the institutional economics and business ecosystems literature.
   Findings - A transcending, service-dominant-logic-based conceptualization of relationship as a general term representing the network-with-and-within-network nature of value creation, with transactions as "temporal isolates" of relationships is suggested.
   Originality/value - This higher-order conceptualization of relationship provides a foundation for better understanding the role of relationship in value creation, as well as its correspondence to transactions and products.

AB Today, telecoms operators have to prove their innovation capacity. They address corporate customers which are involved in collaborative value networks. They implement a process of new services research in order to create adapted solutions. This process is linked to a collaborative and complex practice between diverse innovators. However there is no structured method to leverage this community's knowledge. Based on the SSME1 discussions, we suggest enriching the telecoms innovation approaches by the representation and the simulation of "services systems". This paper also proposes the development of a collaborative tool to support this suggestion and the innovators' practices. Our approach is currently tested on a specific telecom service in the e-health domain which presents an interesting business ecosystem.

AB Recently there has been an explosion of new technologies and tools such as wikis, blogs, tags, Facebook, among many others, that are commonly identified under Web 2.0 and which promise a new digital business ecosystem fed by formal/informal and internal/external relationships and interactions. Although Web 2.0 is very promising to enable such collective knowledge creation, technology by itself is not the only ingredient. It is also required to define the right strategy, governance, culture, processes, training, incentives among others, before implementing such innovative open spaces for collaboration and knowledge sharing. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to present a Knowledge Management (KM) Framework and a Maturity Model developed by a CEMEX and EPFL collaborative research project to discover the AS-IS collaboration practices in CEMEX before the implementation of the SMARTBRICKS Web 2.0 prototype for Business Process Management (BPM), currently under development by the Intelligent Manufacturing Systems (IMS) Swiss Digital Factory (DiFac) project.

TI REGIONAL VIRTUAL PLATFORMS SUPPORTING THE ENTERPRISES' COMPETITIVENESS

DE virtual platform; sustainable development; competitiveness; digital

AB The paper presents the ideas generated by a Romanian Research project "Knowledge management architecture in environmental, social and economic areas, designed to support the sustainable regional development strategy", financed under the national research budget. One major result of the project is represented by the development of a regional virtual platform as a driver for knowledge management and innovation. This virtual environment creates a space for integrating and articulating ideas and innovative solutions in a wide participative way. The platform represents an integrator and mediator for the regional business environment and main stakeholders, as well as a Connectivity channel for bridging other European and world networks and clusters. The global knowledge economy creates new challenges for the industrial space from at least two perspectives: tire development of knowledge products and services, and the increased enterprises' connectivity through complex networks integrating dynamic clusters. The enterprises have to cope with the quick technological changes, with complex organizational systems and with global networking requirements. Consequently, the major enterprise's needs focus oil innovation, in order to increase competitiveness in a sustainable way. In this context, the increased accessibility to the new technologies and innovative solutions, as well as the capacity to generate knowledge and innovation represent the major intangible assets of the global enterprise. The most of the industries, including the metallurgy, are already connected in networks of organizations, technologies, products and consumers, ensuring their visibility, and interactions oil the market. The capacity of increasing the partnerships and various associations represent a major success factor of the actual global enterprise. In the same time, the enterprises are concerned more about the global perspective than about the local one, and consequently have not always strong links with the local development. In this new perspective, the research team identified the gap between the local administration and the regional actors related to the sustainable regional development and proposed the rise of advanced ICT tools for creating a regional virtual platform for supporting the networking among the regional stakeholders and facilitating the development of regional knowledge base, for the benefit of the regional sustainable development. In this perspective, the business actors are more sensitive to the local environmental, economic and social issues, and could contribute to the regional strategy design, as main regional stakeholders. In the same time, the business area will take advantage of the open access to valuable regional knowledge repository and to other platforms, such as digital business ecosystems European platform.

AB Today, the mobile phone industry witnesses important changes, shifting from a value chain to a burgeoning business ecosystem. This paper deals with the relationships that are at the very core of mobile OS ecosystems for IMTs (smartphones and PDA): Microsoft-OS, Symbian-OS, Palm-OS and RIM-OS over the period 1998-2006. Our study confirms that an ecosystem's borders are unclear. More than half of our sample' relationships are shared by at least two different ecosystems. The ecosystems we studied do not differ in terms of exclusive relationship which suggests that coopetitive strategies are particularly relevant in mobile platforms war.

AB The phenomenon of c-business industrial cluster in China has been emerging. Despite the growth in research on the benefits of industrial cluster, our understanding of the process forming the cluster is limited. The study attempts to fill the gap by answering "How has e-business industrial cluster in China been formed?" and "What characterize it?" Applying business ecosystem theory as the theoretical lens, the concept of e-business ecosystem was pointed out first time in this paper to describe the phenomenon of e-business industrial cluster. A case study of Alibaba Group was undertaken to investigate the process that a typical e-business ecosystem in China got shape, developed, and matured. By analyzing the findings from the case study, four stages during e-business ecosystem's evolutionary path and its characteristics are identified. The study has implications for both researchers and practitioners, and valuable for understanding the development of e-business industry in china.

AB Today's enterprises deploy IT to do their business, which introduces significant complexity. This technical complexity combined with organizational complexity can and does create internal "islands of inefficiency" that are difficult to deal with. The notion of the IE is characterized by the ability of businesses to morph into new forms/entities with some surprising results. We envision that in the future IEs will wittingly transform themselves into better forms by becoming "more intelligent". Intelligent enterprises (IEs) have broad horizons with long-term perspectives. They will derive efficiencies through the automation of their core business processes, and the exploitation of knowledge. Agility will be improved by one or two orders of magnitude, intelligence density within the enterprise will grow sharply and problem-solving capacities will be dramatically enhanced. They will form dynamic partnerships with other enterprises to create dynamic business ecosystems, which will be self-managed, self configured and self-optimized. Consequently, they will exploit new forms of business value creation, adjusting their behaviors to the markets.

AB This paper reports research-in-progress that considers standardization as an enabler in business ecosystems. Based on issues encountered, we propose that: business model design is also critical for standards bodies; standards can separate competition from cooperation; standards employ rule-centric designs; and requirements specification and compliance checking are essential. The propositions are illustrated using a standards body with which we have been working.

AB This paper examines new firms creating innovative networks to support their development in emerging industries. Resource-based and evolutionary theories are combined to explain the genesis of a new business ecosystem. Two case studies of biopharm ventures developing drugs against cancer showed how participants altered their selection environment as they enhanced their network's capability. Resource building took place at the firm and network level through collaborative business models involving innovative contractors. This approach uncovered previously unnoticed features of networks for drug development: resource asynchronies were found to be a stimulus to innovation in development networks, as in the Penrosean firm.

TI How companies become platform leaders
SO MIT SLOAN MANAGEMENT REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB An industry platform involves not only one company's technology or service but also an ecosystem of complements to it that are usually produced by a variety of businesses. As a result, becoming a platform leader requires different business and technology strategies than those needed to launch a successful stand-alone product. Companies should decide early on whether they want to pursue a platform or a product strategy.
   The authors describe two fundamental approaches to building platform leadership, which they call "coring" and "tipping." "Coring" is using a set of techniques to create a platform by making a technology "core" to a particular technological system and market. When pursuing a coring strategy, would-be platform leaders should think about issues such as how to make it easy for third parties to provide add-ons to the technology and how to encourage third-party companies to create complementary innovations. Examples of successful coring include Google Inc. in Internet search and Qualcomm Inc. in wireless technology. However, the authors note, Qualcomm faces opposition from some companies in its business ecosystem. The authors cite EMC Corp.'s WideSky initiative in the early 2000s as an attempt at coring that did not succeed. EMC's competitors were not eager to adopt WideSky as a platform and instead supported an open-standards one managed through an industry association.
   "Tipping" is the set of activities that helps a company "tip" a market toward its platform rather than some other potential one. Examples of tipping include Linux's growth in the market for Web server operating systems; the Linux case study, the authors point out, demonstrates the power of a coalition of service providers and users to tip a market by supporting a particular platform. Another tipping strategy is for a company to bundle features from an adjacent market into its existing platform; the authors call this "tipping across markets.".

TI Towards Systematic Achievement of Compliance in Service-Oriented
   Architectures: The MASTER Approach

DT Article
DE Compliance; service-oriented architecture; IT security controls;
   security metrics; run-time monitoring; model-based architecture
AB Service-oriented architectures (SOA) have been successfully adapted by agile businesses to support dynamic outsourcing of business processes and the maintenance of business ecosystems. Still, businesses need to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Abstract service interfaces, distributed ownership and cross-domain operations introduce new challenges for the implementation of compliance controls and the assessment of their effectiveness.
   In this paper, we analyze the challenges for automated support of the enforcement and evaluation of IT security controls in a SOA. We introduce these challenges by means of an example control, and outline a methodology and a high-level architecture that supports the phases of the control lifecycle through dedicated components for observation, evaluation, decision support and reaction. The approach is model-based and features policy-driven controls. A monitoring infrastructure assesses observations in terms of key indicators and interprets them in business terms. Reaction is supported through components that implement both automated enforcement and the provision of feedback by a human user. The resulting architecture essentially is a decoupled security architecture for SOA with enhanced analysis capabilities and will be detailed and implemented in the MASTER project.

TI Innovation in a creative production system: the case of design

DT Article
DE innovation; design; firm; sites
ID KNOWLEDGE; AGGLOMERATION; ORGANIZATION; FIRMS; RISE
AB This article addresses the relatively neglected issue of variations in the degree of innovation and creativity within cultural production systems, paying particular attention to the design consultancy industry. It argues that design is a business-facing type of creative industry that differs in important ways from other types of cultural industries. It examines some of the implications of this argument for how we should understand innovation and its geography in the industry. It is argued that previous studies have paid too much attention to place-based creative inspiration, thereby downplaying the business ecosystems and firm architectures that drive innovation. It is argued that design innovation requires the combination of a wide range of different types of knowledge. Design emerges from interactions between different sites that synthesize and recombine knowledge so as to produce emergent effects and new designs. The article examines two of the key sites: the market or agency-client link and the design firm itself. It argues that relations with clients, and firm routines and competences, are much more important to design innovation than inter-firm co-operation or the local cultural environment. In conclusion it argues that economic geographers should be wary about using approaches to innovation derived from either cultural or manufacturing industries to explain the local ecology of design, but should devote more research to examining the distinctive logics of innovation in creative, knowledge intensive business service industries.

TI The Search for a Dominant Logic A Macromarketing Perspective
SO JOURNAL OF MACROMARKETING
LA English
DT Article
DE service-dominant logic; marketing systems; world view; macromarketing
AB This paper suggests an extension to the Vargo and Lusch (2004) proposal where the fundamental unit of analysis is not the exchange itself but a marketing system within which the service dominant exchange is embedded. The relevant marketing system could range from a micro-system in which the reciprocal creation of value through a single transaction between a buyer and seller is considered, to purposeful, structured, or emergent systems (such as supply chains, business ecosystems, or shopping malls), to the aggregate marketing system. Five criteria are suggested that should be met by any proposed dominant logic or world view. The system-embedded service-dominant (SESD) logic meets all five criteria and may reverse the growing fragmentation occurring in both micro-and macromarketing. It redefines the relationship between micro-and macromarketing and in focusing attention on a meso level of analysis it opens up new horizons for research. In a multidisciplinary setting it highlights what is intrinsic to marketing-exchange within a marketing systems framework.

AB Competitor analysis is critical to strategy formulation and implementation. Firms are able to develop and deploy better strategies if their competitors' responses can be analyzed or even predicted. However, a competitor may initiate certain strategic actions to improve its position. A strategic approach to analyzing competitor responses to a rival's actions in order to achieve a better position would greatly help in the formulation of a firm's business strategy. A DNA analogy shows the way.

AB Can the concept of speciation explain evidence on how technologies branch and advance? Can evidence on innovation through spin-off usefully inform the concept of speciation? These questions are addressed through a case study of detailed processes enabling the shift of technology to new domains of application. An innovative IT firm developed its own semiconductor technology to remedy supplier deficiencies but it required a joint venture with a completely new business model to adapt and move the technology into new market domains. We propose the concept of techno-organizational speciation to delineate this phenomenon. Competing perspectives on speciation (compatibility, niche and lineage approaches) are found to illuminate the evidence, while complementarities between these conceptual dimensions are revealed by the case. Causal processes uncovered include the following: (1) Techno-organizational speciation through spin-off may be needed to launch a dominant technical standard, compatible with multiple applications. (2) This can be achieved through niche creation from which develops a new business ecosystem. (3) Inherited knowledge together with organizationally based learning foster the branching and renewal of technological lineages. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The business environmental structure is constantly being shaped by customer's desires and market dynamics. A large number of loosely interconnected participants make up a business ecosystem, and offers a customized and complete set of products and services. In a business ecosystem, the competitiveness of a company is influenced by its own capability and its interrelated partners' capabilities. Therefore, a company should enhance not only its competitiveness but also related companies' capabilities. To do this, a company has to find its place in the business ecosystem to make a complete business strategy using IT. This paper provides business ecosystem strategies and academic guidelines from the perspective of a single company. Firstly, a business ecosystem perspective is conceptualized, and the importance of a keystone company's role in the ecosystem is examined. Then, using a case study method, focus is put on the keystone's IT capabilities that pave the way for a healthy business ecosystem. This paper explores the Korean Capital Market as an example of a business ecosystem and finds the role of IT, particularly from the perspective of a keystone company. Through this study, it is confirmed that the keystone company's IT capabilities play an important role in the healthy business ecosystem. This paper provides guidelines to practitioners in keystone companies and gives ideas to IT researchers.

AB As the complexity, heterogeneity and dynamism of modern digital business ecosystems increases the long-standing signal-grounding problem remains prominent: It is required that systems are enabled to attach intrinsic meaning to their observable events in context, rather than simply reacting to perceived stimuli most often specified and encoded at design-time. Such a method would align system and process to autonomously characterise, reason and develop reaction models for new (or unforeseen) events. Addressing such a concern will be vital for the design, analysis and engineering of modern ecosystems. Whilst, autonomic computing models via policy-based management of context-aware systems are becoming common-place, further development of the general model, using a random reinforcement learning approach (collectivist memory-based) has been proposed to address the problem. However the growth in the size of the required memory storage capacity and associated efficient access to the distributed knowledge still presents a problem. This paper presents a novel approach to maintaining a situation space, within a situation calculus approach, based on proving that the space conforms to scale-free connectivity from a certain perspective. The special features of the topology may then be used, via an efficient strategy for memory clearance, based on immunisation methods in such networks. This results in a concise ecosystem evolutionary description provided by a core set of action histories.

DE SOA; Web 2.0; Web services; Agents; Virtual Organizations
AB Current ICT trends provide new opportunities to implement some well-known models of e-collaboration between business partners, namely Virtual Organizations. The orientation towards Enterprise Social Computing naturally complements the way companies do business with each other, thus the new Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and Web 2.0 based solutions can help to develop systems better suited for modern business needs. This paper presents an architecture based on SOA and Intelligent agents, which is aimed to address the needs of European SMEs involved in ERP software business. The solution is based on the concept of Digital Business Ecosystem, an environment and software infrastructure, which can help a community of potential business partners to establish and maintain valuable business relationships. Such ecosystem provides its members with value-added services like reputation management, peer-to-peer negotiation of business terms and flexible partner search through usage of Intelligent Agents technology in overall SOA-based framework.

DE Dissolution; Electronic Institutions; Digital Business Ecosystems
AB In the context of the Digital Business Ecosystems, small organizations cooperate between them in order to achieve common goals or offer new services for expanding their markets. There are different approaches for these cooperation models such as Virtual Enterprises, Virtual Organizations or Dynamic Electronic Institutions which in their life-cycle have in common a dissolution phase. However this phase has not been studied deeply in the current literature and it lacks formalization. In this paper a first approach for achieving and managing the dissolution phase is proposed, as well as a CBR process in order to support it in a Multi-Agent System.

   information security e-learning governance
AB Governance has emerged as an important issue for organisations across the world. Governance is the combined activities of developing and managing cohesive and consistent policies, processes and decisions right for a given area of responsibility. For an e-learning ecosystem to work effectively, it is essential that we have the right regulatory, technological and social conditions. This paper discusses a framework to support the successful implementation of an e-learning system includes (1) organisational decision making structures, (2) processes which include operational and technical supports, and (3) communications and relational mechanisms. Six characteristics and dimensions of Darking's [12] digital ecosystem governance were used to enhance the framework. E-learning information security governance is also discussed in the paper. The underlying goals for adopting e-learning governance practices are improvement of business performance and conformance to regulations. This paper discusses governance for learning ecosystems within the digital business ecosystems (DBE).

DE Negotiation; Metamodel; Protocol; Behaviour
AB Digital Business Ecosystems (DBE) are the technical environment where business organisations can live. One important aspect of this type of ecosystem is the collaboration of its members. Successful negotiation processes between members are a fundamental requirement for sustainable collaboration. The contribution of this paper is a negotiation language specified by means of an open metamodel, which provides the basis for SMEs to collaborate within a DBE. The model is presented on the abstraction level of a Metamodel - in the MDA sense of the term - allowing it to be used in a variety of domains and application scenarios. This paper focuses on the introduction of the fundamental concepts of the Metamodel and details of the models it consists of, plus an initial validation by presenting a worked example.

DE Automation; SOA; Manufacturing; Introduction
AB This paper presents research from the Process Definition Tools implementation at Loughborough University, which is an automated manufacturing testbed that has been integrated into a Service Orientated Architecture (SOA). The enablement of this SOA in terms of Digital Business Ecosystem (DBE) research presents new applications to SME's that support, require and supply automated manufacturing systems. These new applications and characteristics in the context of Digital Ecosystem tools, technologies and general architectural changes are examined. In particular new opportunities in virtualisation of automation and integration at both lower and higher levels of distributed applications are presented in a transformed view of a DBE.

DE risk; process; modelling language; collaboration support
AB Nowadays organisations are subjects to frequent changes requiring continuous alignment of business processes. In the adaptive Digital Business Ecosystems (DBEs), agile value chains and the cluster-based bundling of business partners are an essential characteristic. While the resulting flexibility holds opportunities, it increases initially uncertainty. In order to support such organisations to increase their maturity, we suggest a synchronisation of the lifecycles of process management and risk management by integrating both processes. This integration is based on a common modelling language. From the process management perspective, there are number of semi-formal modelling languages while these are missing for risk management. This paper is about a semi-formal modelling language supporting collaboration between the risk management team and the process management one. The synchronised lifecycle appears therefore as the collaboration mechanism coordinating the activities of the heterogeneous team.

AB Change is widely seen as one of the defining characteristics of digital ecosystems. We argue that stability and, in particular, stable foundations are equally important and are, in fact, a precondition for openness to change.
   At present, more and more ICT products become commodities - in fact, the commoditization can be seen as one key drivers behind the radical and rapid changes in the Web-2.0 world. Future economic growth in the Internet requires collaborative and intelligent services and the opportunity for service providers to compose and integrate widely distributed services into adaptable end-to-end business processes. We describe the End-to-End Service Utility (E2ESU) initiative that aims to create a thin, wen specified, linking infrastructure layer atop the current Internet infrastructure that serves as a sound and firm foundation for the value-added services developed by service providers. The utilities are so to say the ground layer in an ecosystem inhabited by utilities, value-added services, and service-based applications.
   However, our notion of utilities challenges the often published assertion that all agents in an ecosystem may mutate without any external restrictions. We contend instead that the basic building blocks of a reliable and dependable infrastructure backbone must vary, but within the limits of clear-cut and well-defined specifications.

DE Trust; Reputation; Ontology; Digital Business Ecosystems
AB Today's e-Businesses rely heavily on trust and reputation systems. These systems are key indicators for businesses performance. Businesses that interact with each other for their business needs form a Digital Business Ecosystem (DBE). Members of DBE need to know the trust and reputation value of each other before the start of business interactions. The feedback mechanism is needed so that members of DBE form a unanimous opinion about trustworthiness of any specific member of the community and based their business interactions on this opinion. We present an ontological framework that will combine the feedback from all different trust and reputation information publicly available for a specific member of a domain and gives the knowledge representation on the bases of combined feedback. We call this ontological framework feedback ontology'.

AB On the transformation of China's telecommunication operators, this paper builds a structure of the industry's ecosystem and value-net model, and further identifies key resources in this ecosystem, including standardization, core technology, customer base and brand names. The conclusion is that an operator's competitive advantage not only depends on its own strength, but also on Its capability of collaboration. That is, whichever operator can best collaborate with others in the ecosystem, will also be able to best integrate resources, and thus establish a self-centered ecosystem and obtain a sustainable advantage.

DE Evolutionary communications; Agent-based modeling; Business ecosystem
AB This paper discusses a new approach to model a complex evolving system, a Digital Business Ecosystem (DBE). We present a geography-based two coupled networks model. The upper layer is the business network layer regarded as an information ecosystem with multiple evolving agents. The lower layer is the underlying P2P communication layer to support communications. The two networks in the system are modelled as evolving over time and interacting with each other. In the business ecosystem, agents exchange services with each other. Through evolution processes, fit services reproduce and weak services die out. We study how these evolution-generated communications affect the topologies of both the business network and the underlying communication network and also system performance. We provide the details of the discrete event simulation and discusses the experimental results. The approach in this paper can be applied to model and analyze other complex real-world applications as our previous work [1].

A two-tier architecture model as a simplified version of the system is presented, consisting of a business network layer and a P2P communication layer that interact with each other and evolve over time. The benefit of the model-driven approach is to allow us running discrete event simulations on it to study, e.g how the topology of the SME network affects the topology of the P2P communication network.

AB This paper introduces a model of negotiation dynamics from the point of view of computational ecology. It inspires an ecosystem monitor, as well as a negotiation style recommender that is novel in state-of-the-art of recommender systems. The ecosystem monitor provided, hints to the negotiation style recommender to achieve a higher stability of any instance of open negotiation environments in a digital business ecosystem.

AB The increasingly complex and dynamic nature of contemporary markets demands that a business engages in an ongoing dialogue with all aspects of its environment, including other cooperative and competitive businesses. Whilst the concept of a business ecosystem captures the essence of such a domain, the lack of a convincing software architecture for its support has resulted in solutions which only partially leverages the potential of the forementioned concept. In this paper, we present an architecture for a business ecosystem supporting application based on Dynamic Agent-based Ecosystem Model (DAEM:) a novel and promising approach to support business ecosystems and their adaptation capabilities where the environment plays an identifiable mediating role.

AB China has 745.44 million peasants, 57% of the total population. But the vast rural area is still at the other side of the information gap. Therefore, how to make ICT beneficial to peasants and agriculture has become the urgent affair of Chinese government and Chinese telecom operators. At present, Chinese rural ICT development has started but whose effect and efficiency are still not satisfied. This paper will describe and analyze the information gap between rural and urban area, and then shows the active strategies which are run by the four leading operators and summarize whose commonness and characteristics. After that, several similar cases abroad are chosen for the sake of getting reference and fresh ideas. At the end, the paper points out some suggestions for Chinese telecom operators on running the rural information market.

AB This paper presents a framework for the modeling and analysis of business model designs involving a network of interconnected business entities. The framework includes an ecosystem-modeling component, a simulation component, and a service-analysis component, and integrates methods from value network modeling, game theory analysis, and multiagent systems. A role-based paradigm is introduced for characterizing ecosystem entities in order to easily allow for the evolution of the ecosystem and duplicated functionality for entities. We show how the framework can be used to provide insight into value distribution among the entities and evaluation of business model performance under different scenarios. The methods are illustrated using a case study of a retail business-to-business service ecosystem.

AB Intense competition has forced the telecommunications industry to continuously develop and deliver new products to market. The key factor in selecting successful products is a comprehensive upfront evaluation of the product's economic viability. This paper introduces a structured methodology to evaluating telecommunication NPIs. The methodology introduces key decision criteria for evaluating the new product's viability based on economic indicators and non-economic selection criteria focused on the business ecosystem within which the new product is being offered. Additionally, sensitivity analysis of input variables is introduced to facilitate evaluation of critical variables and mitigating the associated risks. Though this paper is targeted at the evaluation and analysis of Telecommunication NPIs, the evaluation framework can be applied to any high technology industry.

AB The convergence of forces such as the deepening of the Single Market in the EU, the wider process of globalization and the growing embedded use of information and communication technologies (ICT) in economic and business practices, among others, have brought about a structural break in the theory and practice of regional innovation policy, The need of assessment of these structural breaks the concept of extended and dynamic clustering is designed The concept refers to cluster arrangements that have the following characteristics: though embedded in, transcend geographical location, focus on global markets, operate as ad-hoc and/or long term business networks, are ICT-enabled, and are based on dynamic aggregations of capabilities of different, often small and medium size enterprises (SME). It might be assumed that new organizational arrangements can help SMEs improve their global market access, their capacities for innovation and business performance. In the light of the structural changes underway the challenge for regional innovation policy is how to enable clusters to operate not as regional constellations nurtured by the regional economic base but rather as 'hubs' within a system of flows of economic activity which is increasingly defined on a global basis. This involves the elaboration of an approach to the development and innovation potential of SMEs based on institutional organs dedicated to building regional economic capacity in terms of skills and network development and the construction of international connections to enable regional SMEs to function as 'hubs' operating, between a global economy and regional business ecosystem.
   The new approaches to cluster analysis develop new conceptual dimensions that encapsulate the key aspects of this new phase and better enable all cluster stakeholders address the challenges confronted by regional economies.. This requires a change of perspective where clusters are no longer seen as regionally bound constellations nurtured by regional economic systems but rather as 'hubs' within a global system of flows of information, knowledge and economic activity. This is what the concept of extended and dynamic clustering is designed to capture.
   Current challenges faced by regional clusters can be confronted through a process Of extended and dynamic clustering that improves market access, innovation capabilities and adaptability to the emerging structural realities of the EU. Extended and dynamic clustering involves selecting and aggregating capabilities Of clustered SMEs at regional, national, cross-regional or international levels, thus overcoming regional geographical boundaries and operational limitations of 'traditional' clusters.
   Currently, due to size, scale, specialization and not least regulatory and legal impediments, SMEs in the EU lack the capacity to respond adequately to emerging challenges from international locations and market opportunities, or participate in tenders in international procurement contracts. This shortcoming is related to both the conditions that SMEs face and the restrictions associated with 'traditional' geographically defined regional clusters.

DE Commercial ecosystem; tourism ecosystem; growth mode
AB Effective tourism operation is the result of many components working together. Through the absorption and integration of resources, tourism industry can form complex ecological system, namely, tourism business ecosystem, which takes tourism attraction as the centre and shows complex adaptive characteristics. Commercial ecosystem theory can fit the nature of tourism perfectly. In this study, we explore the constitution of tourism ecosystem, describe its characteristics such as vegetality, parasitism, adorability, fissionability, and nestedness. We also analyze the three growth modes of tourism ecosystem which are endogenous growth, derivative growth and symbiotic growth.

AB This paper uses the principles of business ecology to analyze the problems in China's e-business construction and probe in the ways for enterprises in different niches to carry out e-business; construction. The e-business construction is not the isolated behavior of certain one enterprise and full consideration should be taken into the relations between upper stream and down stream enterprises to form c-business ecosystem. The keystone role of the keystone enterprises in forming e-business ecosystem should be brought into fall play. The existence of a great number of nicher enterprises marks a healthy e-business ecosystem, and the dominating enterprises should be restricted and then transformed into the keystone enterprises. Different enterprises in different niches should have different e-business strategies. The hetero-organizations of the government are of great importance to the formation and health of e-business ecosystem.

AB This paper focuses on implementation solutions for developing an ecosystem of self-organizing, competing and evolving distributed data mining Web-based services. Specific options are considered, such as: designing an integrated architecture on top of which a portal is built as a gateway for knowledge exchange and intelligent business transactions; exploiting recently released standard interfaces and communications protocols that allows to integrate remote web services into portals as portlets, and to run portlets remotely, for interoperable data mining tasks; adoption of a standard Java API along with a Data Mining Engine and a Metadata Repository, allowing developing a service-oriented distributed data mining platform; XML-based standard representation of predictive models for facilitating the export and import of data mining objects; providing mechanisms for exposing and consuming distributed data mining services. An Enterprise Knowledge Portal that integrate Distributed Data Mining functionality either locally or remotely acts as a core of an enterprise-wide network system allowing the end-users to work collaboratively, quickly share information and knowledge inferred by analytical tools such as Data Mining models. All functionality can be accessed via a standard Web browser across different locations or branches of a corporation.

DE context; criteria; failurelevel; time phase; time slots; trusting agent;
   trusted agent
AB In digital business ecosystem architecture it is rational for the trusting agent to analyse the possible risk according to its demand before interacting with a probable trusted agent. Doing so would assist the trusting agent in its decision process and would also give the trusting agent a hint of the direction in which the interaction might head. The possible risk in an interaction is a combination of the probability of failure and the possible consequences of failure of an interaction. In this paper, we propose a methodology by which the trusting agent determines the probability of failure in interacting with a probable trusted agent. The determined probability of failure by the trusting agent is according to the specific demand of its future interaction with the probable trusted agent. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The growing diffusion of outsourcing and insourcing practices in companies life motivated by enterprise efficiency, costs reduction policies and the increasing market dynamicity have motivated the need of distributed service oriented information systems. The Business Ecosystems (BEs) concept defined by James Moore to describe the evolving interaction of business world elements, is taking advantage of the Web 2.0 and B2B networking systems paradigms. These technologies have enabled enterprises to efficiently cooperate in the digital world towards the creation of Digital Ecosystems (DEs). An essential element of DEs is represented by the negotiation of alliances, which enable companies to join competences as well as services and products into a complex offering. This paper describes the Open Negotiation Environment (ONE) project who's aim is to empower the DEs vision with a distributed multi-party multi-issue negotiation platform. ONE will provide sophisticated negotiations processes and supporting tools, enriched by learning and optimisation capabilities. With this approach, ONE will permit an DE to dynamically package and compose complex services through negotiating alliances of loose networks of suppliers, distributors, and outsourcers.makers of related products or services; providers of relevant technology; and other organizations, that could evolve over time.

AB In a financial digital business ecosystem, the trusting agent by analyzing beforehand the possible risk in interacting with a probable trusted agent can make a better decision of its future course of interaction with it. Another factor that would help the trusting agent in deciding whether to interact or not with a probable trusted agent, is to determine the probability of it not achieving the full benefit of its invested resources. In this paper, we propose a methodology by which the trusting agent can determine the loss of its resource benefit in interacting with a probable trusted agent before proceeding.

AB Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is gaining acceptance in many application domains as a way to structure system for flexibility and for better alignment with business goals. Peer-to-peer (P2P) systems are suited to digital ecosystems for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) because they allow each service client machine to act also as a service provider. There is no large enterprise that acts as a central hub in the network of business relationships. SMEs organize themselves in complex web of dynamic inter-relationships within the digital ecosystem. Most present P2P system had been designed with a fixed infrastructure in mind rather than a wireless or mobile infrastructure. However, mobile wireless smart-phones are increasingly being used as business tools. This paper proposes an intelligent agent mediated peer-to-peer service-oriented architecture (SOA) that could be used to address the dynamic requirements of a mobile and fixed infrastructure and hence provide a seamless service environment of for SME digital business ecosystems.

AB In recent years, IT governance has become a key concern issue for senior IT decision makers across various industries. When appropriately implemented, IT governance can play the role of a central nervous system effectively ensuring the wellbeing of the organizational system. The health of the organizational system ultimately contributes to the health of the distributed business ecosystem in which the organization co-exists with other organizations. The underlying goals for adopting formal IT governance practices are improvement of business performance and conformance with regulations. This exploratory study examined how IT governance is implemented in four Australian institutions of higher education through a number of IT governance structures, processes, and relational mechanisms. This paper discusses the importance of these practices as these institutions increasingly compete and collaborate with each other, various government agencies and other research institutions in the digital economy.

AB In this paper we describe an architecture, a language and an interactive graphical editor for the semantic description of services in Digital Business Ecosystem Environments. For the semantic description of business services, a MOF metadata modelling approach has been adopted where a meta-model provides the modelling elements needed to build custom service description models. The architecture can utilize complex or simple structures from diverse domain ontologies in order to specialise service models to business domains and also to allow for business differentiation through model variations. Finally we describe the implementation of the system as well as a UML-like interactive editor that facilitates the creation of the semantic service models.

DE query language; MOF; modelling; semantic discovery
AB In a Digital Business Ecosystem (DBE) information on the businesses and the services they provide may be described in terms of models and data which are used to semantically discover partners and services. The Object Management Group (OMG) defines a four layered modelling architecture, the Model Driven Architecture (MDA), which provides mechanisms for rapid development of modelling languages addressing domain problems using the Meta Object Facility (MOF). MOF incorporates object oriented concepts and is a subset of UML. Furthermore, as users typically don't know how to make requests, the system has to be tolerant. The Query Metamodel Language (QML) is a language that exploits the Object Constraint Language (OCL) (which is very closely associated with UML and therefore MOF) to provide powerful query support on model repositories. This paper presents the motivation for QML along with its abstract syntax. It also introduces the framework for QML processing that incorporates information retrieval functionality and is used to formulate fuzzy queries using the extended boolean model. It describes how QML is integrated in the MOF architecture and how semantic expansion of queries and evaluation can be done in an effective way.

DE digital business ecosystem (DBE); interoperability; enterprise
   architecture (EA); ontology data modelling and multi-site project
   management (MSPM) ontology methodology
AB While digital business ecosystem is emerging as a paradigm in next generation of system development and business servicing models, the design goal has not changed. The aim is still about achieving interoperability - the convergence of ICT integration, business processes and human interaction into an optimised model for not just digitalising enterprises' business servicing but maximising competitive advantage. Business researchers, such as Hill, Prahalad, Hamel, Miller, Eisenstat and Foote, are recognising the importance of using Enterprise Architecture methodologies in bringing together people, process and ICT resources and their capabilities to create core competencies for strategic advantage. In light of this recognition, there is value in incorporating EA governance in DBE development. Another value add to DBE development is using emerging ontology methodologies in defining DBE knowledge structures. Ontology is the study and conceptualisation of domain knowledge based on agreements of formal methods and product frameworks. In DBE development, ontology methodologies can be used to foster social and technology semantic knowledge sharing in DBE project management and SDLC workflows, and DBE product designs through using open standards in DBE data modelling. One such ontology methodology that fulfils these two role requirements is the MSPM ontology methodology, a Curtin University research product nearing completion. The MSPM ontology methodology can be potentially extended and exploited for future DBE research and development.

AB A primary motivation for research in digital ecosystems is the desire to exploit the self-organising properties of natural ecosystems. Ecosystems are thought to be robust, scalable architectures that can automatically solve complex, dynamic problems. However, the biological processes that contribute to these properties have not been made explicit in digital ecosystem research. Here, we discuss how biological properties contribute to the self-organising features of natural ecosystems. These properties include populations of evolving agents, a complex dynamic environment, and spatial distributions which generate local interactions. The potential for exploiting these properties in artificial systems is then considered. An example architecture, the Digital Business Ecosystem (DBE), is considered in detail. Simulation results imply that the DBE performs better at large scales than a comparable service-oriented architecture. These results suggest that incorporating ideas from theoretical ecology can contribute to useful self-organising properties in digital ecosystems.

   architecture (EA); ontology data modelling and multi-site project
   management (MSPM) ontology methodology
AB While digital business ecosystem is emerging as a paradigm in next generation of system development and business servicing models, the design goal has not changed. The aim is still about achieving interoperability - the convergence of ICT integration, business processes and human interaction into an optimised model for not just digitalising enterprises' business servicing but maximising competitive advantage. Business researchers, such as Hill, Prahalad, Hamel, Miller, Eisenstat and Foote, are recognising the importance of using Enterprise Architecture methodologies in bringing together people, process and ICT resources and their capabilities to create core competencies for strategic advantage. In light of this recognition, there is value in incorporating EA governance in DBE development. Another value add to DBE development is using emerging ontology methodologies in defining DBE knowledge structures. Ontology is the study and conceptualisation of domain knowledge based on agreements of formal methods and product frameworks. In DBE development, ontology methodologies can be used to foster social and technology semantic knowledge sharing in DBE project management and SDLC workflows, and DBE product designs through using open standards in DBE data modelling. One such ontology methodology that fulfils these two role requirements is the MSPM ontology methodology, a Curtin University research product nearing completion. The MSPM ontology methodology can be potentially extended and exploited for future DBE research and development.

AB Information technology and the Internet favour the development of business networks, in which business partners cooperate to produce composite products and services that meet the customer needs. Customer participation in these networks, even though necessary, is usually neglected or submissive to the needs of the business enterprises. Based on the metaphor of 'business ecosystems', this paper argues for the need to introduce customers as active members of business networks and proposes a conceptual and a business model of customer-centric business ecosystems. The business model is based on a technological platform, which enables the development, the dynamic configuration and the coordination of the customer-centric business ecosystem. The operations of the platform follow the paradigm of service oriented architectures and they can be implemented with the use of web services. The paper discusses also the strategic aspects of the development of customer-centric business ecosystems.

AB \This paper aims at describing the effort realised by ISUFI in defining the Business Modelling Language (BML), in the widest context of the Digital Business Ecosystem (DBE) Project. One of the main obstacles in the adoption of e-business technologies from organisations and communities depends on the divide between technologies, which have reached a quite high level of maturity, and methodologies enabling business knowledge modelling. These methodologies are, on one side, not enough connected with software development and management processes and, on the other, poorly usable and understandable from business users. BML has as main purpose to allows a more simple communication among business people involved in e-business scenario, granting at the same time a strong expressivity and formal logic mapping.

AB As service-oriented computing technologies mature and gain acceptance, the focus of the research community shifts toward applications, business concerns, and business value creation. Service-oriented business ecosystems are one such emerging research area. In our previous work, we argued for a structuring mechanism enabling service communities in business ecosystems - dynamic, customizable groups of services provided and used by membership-based social or business networks of varying scale and lifetime. This paper develops the idea of service communities further in three ways. First, we study a variety of motivating business scenarios and articulate the business value of applying the community concept to services. Second, we provide technical details of our middleware platform that supports the runtime creation and management of service communities. Third, we discuss extensions of the general service community idea for further value creation and research.

AB India has a rich foundation of clusters, and initiatives to boost the various functional areas of a cluster by pinpointing the anomalies that cloud them can lead to their dynamism. The digital ecosystem (DE) is one approach through which diffusion and use of ICT can be made self sustaining and self enabling for clusters, specifically clusters that thrive on value addition through embodying their product with skill and craftsmanship. This paper reports initial empirical findings from a collaborative project called the 'Digital Mandi'. The digital ecosystem entails a series of interconnected and intra-dependant digital platforms, created at key institutional levels (international, national and local/Community) augmented by technical (ICT) and social networking processes that help break down barriers to both horizontal and vertical knowledge sharing. The empirical findings show that the 'ecosystem' approach speeds up the process of identification, development and uptake of innovation. We conclude that similar DBEs can be effective for skill based SME clusters facing similar challenges of competitiveness in a rapidly globalizing knowledge driven economy.

AB In this paper we present a model for coordinating distributed long running and multi-service transactions in Digital Business EcoSystems. The model supports various forms of service composition, which are translated into a tuples-based behavioural description that allows to reason about the required behaviour in terms of ordering, dependencies and alternative execution. The compensation mechanism warranties consistency, including omitted results, without breaking local autonomy. The proposed model is considered at the deployment level of SOA, rather than the realisation level, and is targeted to business transactions between collaborating SMEs as it respects the loose-coupling of the underlying services.

AB Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) most often lack resources for custom-made software solutions that support best their core businesses. In this paper a simulation framework for self-optimising SME networks, namely Evolutionary Environment Simulator (EvESimulator), is introduced. The Evolutionary Environment, which the framework bases on, is an infrastructural component for distributed and decentralised service creation and service improvement based on mechanisms that are operating similarly in the living environment. This paper concentrates on the simulation of these mechanisms for SME networks. Built upon the widely-used simulation framework Repast, the cooperation behaviour of companies is investigated that use self-optimizing software services and distribute related information amongst them. The simulator is capable of importing real-world data from real businesses thereby enabling conceptual studies and hypothesis testing. It is applied in the context of three utilisation scenarios that investigate critical mass for sustainability, clustering in general, and usage-based clustering. The first results of the EvESimulator reveal a dynamic creation of a growing network of businesses that is clearly outperforming centralized topologies in the long run.

DE digital ecosystems; negotiation; contracts; open source
AB The Digital Ecosystem (DES) paradigm and consequently Digital Business Ecosystems (DBE) are powerful emerging inter-company cooperative structures. One of the main advantages of an ecosystem is the enabling of alliances among companies with complementary or even competitive competences in order to be able to provide complex offerings beyond the capabilities of a single company. The process of negotiation and contracting of complex services that can be provided in a cooperative manner by member companies of the ecosystem is an essential binding element among them. The intention of this paper is to explain how the Open Negotiation Environment (ONE) will extend DES research providing sophisticated negotiations processes and supporting tools, enriched by learning and optimisation capabilities, that will allow an organisation to dynamically package and compose complex services by negotiating alliances.

AB A Business Ecosystem is a term introduced by James Moore(1) where in "The Death of Competition: Leadership and Strategy in the Age of Business Ecosystems"[1] wrote on page 26 that a Business Ecosystem is based on dynamic interaction of organizations which evolves over time their capabilities and roles. To this extent this paper will tell that Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is not adequate to face such challenges which are unique in the context of a Digital Ecosystem (DES). The author will highlight such differences and describe the features of a new architectural style: called Ecosystem Oriented Architecture (EOA).
   The paper will explore the fact that a DES oriented architecture is not a "sort of SOA", it's not just a "bigger SOA". A whole set of new problems are to be addressed namely responsive alignment with the business, decentralization, ownership of the knowledge base and self healing.
   EOA is a new mindset in decentralized architectures for DES.

DE knowledge base; SOA; P2P; semantic discovery
AB We consider a digital business ecosystem environment where SMEs cooperate and compete. We aim to provide to each SME and the ecosystem with knowledge management mechanisms to support their needs for information, service findings and recommendations. We present the design and implementation of a platform that supports the knowledge management needs in this environment. We describe the business related knowledge managed by the Knowledge Base (KB), as well as the architectural components and the core services supported by the KE infrastructure. Since the SMEs are independent and their KB contents are evolving we adopted a P2P framework for the cooperation of SMEs. We present the P2P framework and we outline the knowledge discovery and replication mechanisms supported by the implementation. The knowledge management mechanisms described in this paper form the infrastructure for knowledge management of the Digital Business Ecosystem IP project of EU.

AB The digital business ecosystem is an innovative approach to support the adoption and development of information and communication technologies (ICT). A natural life ecosystem is a biological community of interacting organisms and their physical environments. Conversely, a business ecosystem is a network of buyers, suppliers and makers of related products or services, plus the socio-economic environment that includes the institutional and regulatory framework. The development process of an OSS environment can be modelled as an information ecosystem. This paper describes how activity theory can be used to inform the development of OSS projects.

DE mobile multimedia; digital business ecosystems; quality of service; 3G
   and 4G mobile systems
AB The Digital Business Ecosystem (DBE) paradigm envisages a business environment in which digitised content plays paramount role in the successful operation of Small to Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Use of multimedia content - that includes text, audio, stills and moving images - has become the norm for most business and personal communications. The third generation (3G) mobile communications infrastructure aims to provide the ability to deliver this content over wireless networks. However, achieving the desired Quality of Service (QoS) remains a challenge. The fourth generation (4G) mobile systems are expected to tackle this problem over the coming years.
   Multimedia information and mobile communication systems need to become an integral part of the process adopted for the development of DBEs. The ability to transmit multimedia information effectively will play a significant role in the adoption of the DBE paradigm by the SMEs.

DE DBE; SME; regional development
AB The Digital Business Ecosystem (DBE) project experimented with new ways of bringing Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) into a major R&D project. Such involvement is an important factor in projects where the R&D performers are not the exploiters.
   The project utilised the social capital of regional actors, and conceptualised a certain kind of SME, known as Driver SMEs. The strategy adopted has worked for this project and has pro-vided a basis for self-sustained post-project expansion. In doing so it has created a model that could easily be adopted by other projects, both in Digital Ecosystems and beyond.

AB This paper is based on the research work done under the EU-FP6 research firamework by the Digital Business Ecosystems project task WP32-B11. This research work has been part Of an ongoing research attempt, aiming to develop a knowledge base of regulatory issues that arise,from small medium enteiprises (SMEs) membership of a Digital Business Ecosystem (DBE), primarily associated with development of FS/OS Software for commercial use. The view taken was to identify trust as the main component for SME participation in the DBE, and to analyze some main areas for trust regulation: privacy, e-signatures and security, jurisdiction and consumer protection. The paper concludes with remarks regarding the potential implications of developing a knowledge base of regulatory issue in the use of FS/OS software in the European SME sector for current and future SME engagement, whereas the knowledge base of regulatory issues is still being empirically tested and populated.

AB We present a study in product chain creation in a Digital Business Ecosystem (DBE). We perform the study using a simulated DBE. It was created by a software package that receives statistical data from a real DBE as input and outputs a realistic simulated model consisting of a certain number of companies and services. Issues of trust between companies are modelled using the psychophysical law of Weber Fechner and their effect on the quality of the chains of products created is studied.

DE reliability; businesses; service oriented architecture; digital

AB A key indicator of today's global business system supported by Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), is the reliability and uptime. This concern is crucial for e-commerce sites and mission-critical business applications. SOA modelling is used to implement the concept of Digital Business Ecosystem (DBE). In computing environment of DBE a chain of components link business applications together, and the strength of this chain, in terms of reliability and performance, will determine the success or failure of the business. One way to make the chain stronger is to increase the reliability of all components involved, especially the critical components of the chain. In this paper, we address the reliability issue of Digital Ecosystem's transactions. The major contribution of this research is to propose a framework for reliable transactions in DE, via the analysis of the reliability for web services computing.

AB In a digital business ecosystem environment the trusting agent by analysing beforehand the possible risk in interacting with a probable trusted agent, can make a better decision of its future course of interaction with it. A possible outcome of Risk is the loss to trusting agent's resources involved in the interaction. In a financial interaction, the possible loss that may be incurred is usually the monetary loss in the resources of the trusting agent that are involved in the interaction. In this paper, we propose a methodology by which the trusting agent can determine beforehand the possible Risk in financial terms or the possible loss to its resources as a result of interacting with a probable trusted agent.

AB The popularity of the French Videotex system (also known as Minitel) as the first successful electronic content delivery channel, prior to the rise of the Internet, is widely acknowledged. There is a significant degree of similarity between the French Videotex business model and current business models used for mobile data services, with a particular mention for the i-mode model implemented by the Japanese NTT-Docomo. This similarity can be explained by the presence of similar barriers; to the successful launch of a new network-based service, and in particular of network externalities and other sources of increasing returns. Some differences however can be observed, due to specific path dependencies, business traditions, market size, and technological standard choices. In Japan, we can therefore observe a system of competing vertical business networks, each one mimicking a kind of Videotex business model. In France, the system is characterised by significant horizontal relationships between vertical networks, aiming at providing benefits to those provided by the former monopoly-based Videotex system. In this paper, we analyse the French and Japanese cases from a business network and ecosystem perspective, highlighting how specific conditions and path dependencies have given rise to different business network configurations.

AB This paper proposes to create a monitor of digital business ecosystems so that it provides agents with information to improve the behaviour of the ecosystem in terms of stability. This work proposes that, in digital ecosystems, monitor techniques can provide fundamental services and information. The final goal is to run the monitor algorithms, generate recommendation strategies and test them. A set of evaluation metrics must be defined as well. We want to provide an Outline of some global indicators, such as heterogeneity and diversity, and establish relationships between agent behaviour and these global indicators of system performance.

AB The increasing popularity of the "business ecosystem" concept in (business) strategy reflects that it is seen as one way to cope with increasingly dynamic and complex business environments. Nevertheless, the lack of a convincing model of a business ecosystem has led to the development of software which only give organisations a partial aid whilst neglecting their need for adaptation. Research in Multi-Agent Systems has proved to be suitable for modelling interactions among disparate sort of entities such as organisations. On the other hand, natural ecosystems continue to adapt themselves to changes in their dynamic and complex environments. In this paper, we present the Dynamic Agent-based Ecosystem Model. It combines ideas from natural ecosystems and multi-agent systems for business interactions.

AB In this paper, which is exploratory in nature, we introduce how to use Dynamic Electronic Institutions to enable Digital Business Ecosystems. A Digital Business Ecosystem is an evolutionary self-organising system aimed at creating a digital software environment for small organisations. These new forms of networked business require a multi-disciplinary approach based on biology, computer science and social sciences mechanisms and models. Our proposal is to use a multi-agent approach in combination with some social sciences metaphors. More specifically, we propose to imagine the digital environment of business ecosystems as an open agent system, and to study the spontaneous composition and adaptation of the different services and software components, by using Dynamic Electronic Institutions, which we have recently presented in our latest works. In this paper we present a brief summary of our previous work on dynamic institutions, and our first ideas on how to enable Digital Business Ecosystems.

ID ECOLOGY
AB The modern business environment is an interlocking network of large number of groups of people interacting with computer systems, and which themselves interact with a variety of physical and ecological systems to maintain them under conditions of good control. The enormous complexity and vast quantity of information involved make modeling and simulation approaches necessary and yet the existing formalisms available for these activities are not sufficient to reflect their full characteristics.
   During the last ten years, two paradigms arose from considering business as a complex system in interaction with other systems from its complex environment. These paradigms refer to the virtual organizations and digital business ecosystems.
   In this paper we first discuss the current state-of-the-art of the use of modeling and simulation main techniques and methods on these two kinds of systems. A virtual enterprise is composed of a number of semi-independent autonomous entities (agents) representing different individuals, departments and firms each of which having a range of problem-solving capabilities and resources of their disposal. Sometimes these entities co-exist and compete to each one another in a ubiquitous virtual marketplace. Each entity attempts to attract potential customers for its products and services, with the goal of selling them in a way that maximizes their individual profit. Sometimes, however, one or more of these may realizes that there are potential benefits from pooling resources either with a competitor (to form a coalition) or with an entity with complementary capabilities (to offer a new type of product or service who is demand on the market). When this potential or market opportunity is recognized, the relevant entities go through a process of trying to form a new entity, named virtual enterprise, to exploit the perceived niche.
   Then we present the digital business ecosystem as a relatively new concept in the field of business research in which the firms are interpreted to be the equivalents of organisms of biological ecosystems. A business ecosystem is defined to consist of organizations that can be both business firms and public sector organizations. The environment of a DBE consists of things like inflation, interest levels, weather conditions, pollution and other business ecosystems, with which the components of the business ecosystem may interact with but are not active members of that entity. The interaction between a DBE and its environment is a source of unpredictable dynamics.
   These two kinds of complex systems have some fundamental properties that make modeling and simulation of them somehow similar. Instead of defining a new set of models for each of them, the paper present a method of build models on two different perspectives: a structural perspective defining elements and relationships of a virtual enterprise and a process perspective defining functions and roles for the evolution and renewal of a business ecosystem as an answer to changing customer demands or market conditions.
   This suggests that virtual enterprises and digital business ecosystems can be systematically linked, being two forms of the same entity: the networked virtual company.

AB The concept of business ecosystems is a new, powerful metaphor that steps forward the movement towards symbiotic and co-evolutionary business networks. The literature describes business ecosystems as economic communities comprised of a number of business entities that are closely related the one to the other with symbiotic relationships; as a result, they constantly interact and seek to co-operate to fulfill their particular goals and attain mutual benefits. In this paper we discuss the role of customers in business ecosystems. We argue that the concept of business ecosystems is focused on the needs and the roles of the producers and neglects the customers, especially the end-customers. We analyse the impact of customers' participation as active members in business ecosystems and suggest that it intensifies their co-evolutionary character and increases their dynamism. We discuss technological aspects of customer participation in business ecosystems.

AB To ascertain the possible level of risk in a digital business ecosystem interaction, the initiating agent has to determine beforehand the probability of failure, the possible consequences of failure, and the loss of investment probability to its resources while interacting with the other agent. Out of these three constituents, the initiating agent can determine beforehand the probability of failure in interacting with an agent either by considering its past interaction history with it or by soliciting recommendations from other agents. In both cases. it is imperative for the agent who is either considering its past interaction history, or who is communicating a recommendation about the other agent, to know the accurate level of failure in interacting with the other agent. To achieve this, in this paper we propose a methodology by which the initiating agent of the interaction ascertains the level of failure in the interaction, after interacting with an agent.

AB Omnipresent in many scientific disciplines nowadays is the notion of 'system' in the sense of a set of interacting, mutually influencing independent but adaptive actors with different roles and authorities in a dynamic, se self-organising and se self-regulating configuration. Business settings are compared to ecosystems. In computer science, the metaphor of a 'swarm' has been introduced Any successful (human or artificial) agent interaction requires interoperability and meaning agreement next to trust and privacy. The vision of the Semantic Web incorporates these aspects, although it is argued that the complementary social aspects of the Web2.0 should be added In this paper, we present an ontology, engineering methodology that addresses these issues. And we advocate the idea of "Pragmatic Webs" as a way of enabling Digital Business Ecosystems.

AB The global evolutionary business environment is increasingly populated by a large number of networked organizations interacting with each other and with a variety of environmental conditions to adapt, evolve and maintain them under conditions of good control. This paper proposes cybersemiotics as a conceptual framework for agent based simulation of decision making processes within Digital Business Ecosystems, which are complex, evolutionary, self-organizing, autopoietic, and knowledge-centric business environments. We argue that semiotic agents are equipped with most appropriate characteristics to accomplish such a task. They are deliberative, dynamically uncoupled to their environments,.engage processes of perception, interpretation, decision and action with their environments, possess internally stored representations of measured states of affairs, goal states and possible actions, have means to describe and handle their own preferences and beliefs, can coordinate actions and learn about their environment through communication.

DT Article
ID GOVERNANCE; VENTURES
AB This article uses a family-influenced, international, new venture creation case as a platform for addressing the importance of context when exploring entrepreneurship in start-up and growth companies. I raise crucial issues about how agency relationships and costs are evaluated in family firms, arguing that the competitiveness implications of agency can only be fully assessed in light of the larger context considerations. I suggest that agency is best evaluated as inputs and outputs in a contextual ecosystem. I utilize a family business ecosystems model to show that family is a distinct context for entrepreneurship and that it generates an idiosyncratic bundle of resources and capabilities that provide a potential agency advantage in new venture creation. Since the case findings indicate that the agency inputs and outputs change over time, I conclude by placing the potential agency advantages and constraints into an organizational life cycle framework. The goal of the article is to further the discussion on how families find their advantage in the entrepreneurial process.

ID MANN GULCH
AB In this paper, we explore some of Claudio Ciborra's ideas about the technological object. We do this in contrast to recent analysis by Law and Singleton (L&S) that advocates a methodological radicalism that moves beyond epistemological uncertainties about the technological object to ontological concerns. L&S present a series of stages in this analysis that include fluid objects that change relatively gently and fire objects that have more radical discontinuities. This approach is applied to empirical work studying the engagement practices of a large, sophisticated information infrastructure research project, the Digital Business Ecosystem (DBE). At the start of the DBE engagement process, the DBE was an invisible technology that did not exist and this made the process of engagement with it particularly challenging. Drawing on the analysis presented by, however, the DBE appears to have the ontological characteristics of both the fluid and the fire object. In order to address this dilemma, we draw upon Ciborra's thinking, particularly around the information infrastructure and Gestell as a means that allows us to consider technologies like the DBE as being both fluid and fire objects. The paper ends with a discussion of the implications of this work on Claudio Ciborra's legacy for the study of information and communications technologies.

AB Software agents are often seen as flexible goal-driven software technology suitable for dynamic environments such as business ecosystems. The inherently open and unpredictable nature of such environments, however, renders unsuitable many widely used agent design mechanisms, such as agent interaction protocols. This paper describes an approach which addresses the need for flexible inter-agent interactions. Our approach gives agents freedom of action and enhances their ability to respond to unexpected events in open environments. We base our argument on the limitations of protocol-based approaches used to formalize agent interaction. We then investigate the possibility of protocol-free agent interaction to enable flexible operation of agent systems in dynamic environments.

AB Since Alan Turing in the 50's, there have been many biologically-inspired approaches to intelligence and autonomy for machines and software. Commonly, these approaches explored one particular level of organization of living species (e.g. cell, tissue, organ or organ systems) or one particular set of behaviors. Many have arrived at obtaining amazing results. They however experienced conceptual and implementation limitations. One major issue is that while the human-like higher level capabilities such as intelligence are desired for machine and software, there has been no similar foundation, structural and/or functional, that could be established between the complete range of human levels of organizations and those of a human-made system (machine, software or both). In our previous investigations, we have argued that there is a general parallelism between the concept of software continuum (from bits to business ecosystems) and that of the natural continuum (from particles to natural ecosystems). We claimed that the general parallelism suggests possible mappings between the two continua. The mappings in turn suggest that the processes or mechanisms that work in one continuum can be investigated for applicability to the other continuum. This paper introduces an architecture framework for the creation and development of biologically-inspired intelligent and autonomous software species. The development is bottom-up, i.e. in a fashion similar to the creation, growth and development of a human newborn to acquire intelligent and autonomous behaviors. The development of such as software species is needed for future applications with robust intelligence and robust autonomy in different domains such as business, medical, industrial, governmental and military.

AB In digital business ecosystem architecture, it is rational for the trusting agent to analyse the possible risk in interacting with a probable trusted agent beforehand. Doing so would assist the trusting agent in its decision process. The possible risk in an interaction is a combination of the probability of failure and the possible consequences of failure of an interaction. In this paper, we propose an approach by which the trusting agent determines the probability of failure in interacting with a probable trusted agent according to the demand of its future interaction with it.

This new currency better reflects the wealth of nations throughout the world, supports more social economic activity and is better adapted to the challenges of digital business ecosystems. The basic premise of the new currency is a knowledge measurement pattern that is formulated as a new alternative social currency. Therefore, it is a first step contributing to the worldwide evolution towards a knowledge society. It is a currency to facilitate the conservation and storage of knowledge, its organization and categorization, but chiefly its transference and exploitation. The proposal turns recommender agents into the new currency. An example is presented to show how recommender agents receive a new use, transforming them into objects of transaction.

AB The e-business ecosystem generates pressure on modern companies to invest massively in technologies that can bring them into the digital world of business-to-business collaboration. In their race to become a player of the global information system, companies have accumulated many layers of software. This situation has generated what is now known as the software complexity issue. What is missing in most organizations is a mechanism that can align or "bridge the gap" between the concerns Of corporate strategists and IT project managers considering the business-to-business collaboration issues. As a consequence, a new discipline has evolved, enterprise engineering (also known as enterprise modelling), to deal with enterprise architectures. The enterprise architecture describes the logical linkages between the enterprise business, information and IT infrastructure. Many standards for building enterprise architectures have been recently adopted addressing multiple modelling perspectives: business, design and technology. This paper will provide both a survey of today's enterprise engineering standards and a framework for identifying the appropriate combination that enterprises can use to enable adhoc systems-to-systems collaboration.

AB A business ecosystem is a system that describes interactions between organizations. In this paper, we build a theoretical framework that defines a model which can be used to analyze the business ecosystem. The basic concepts within the framework are organizations, business connections, and market, that are all defined in the paper. Many researchers analyze the performance and structure of business using the workflow of the business. Our work in business connections answers a different set of questions, concerning the monetary value in the business ecosystem, rather than the task-interaction view that is provided by workflow analysis.
   We apply methods for analysis of the topology of complex networks, characterized by the concepts of small path length, clustering, and scale-free degree distributions. To model the dynamics of the business ecosystem we analyze the notion of the state of an organization at a given instant of time. We point out that the notion of state in this case is fundamentally different from the concept of state of the system which is used in classical or quantum physics. To describe the state of the organization at a given time one has to know the probability of payments to contracts which in fact depend on the future behavior of the agents on the market. Therefore methods of p-adic analysis are appropriate to explore such a behavior. Microeconomic and macroeconomic factors are indivisible and moreover the actual state of the organization depends on the future. In this framework some simple models are analyzed in detail. Company strategy can be influenced by analysis of models, which can provide a probabilistic understanding of the market, giving degrees of predictability.

AB The globalization of economics and the development of science and technology make the world more and more complicated. With this kind of complicated environment, each firm should build up some business models which could share profit with its competitors instead of monopoly so as to construct a healthy business system for all together which has endogenous impetus to progress and be contingent to the environment. This article is committed to analyze the characters and challenges of IT in different developing stages and single out some effective impetus to break through the "bottle-neck" with business ecosystem theory.

AB Professional Virtual Communities (PVC) are emerging as human centred new organizational arrangements aimed at leveraging knowledge development, value creation and social welfare. This paper is aimed at defining a conceptual framework for the characterization of PVC, suitable for ascertaining the correlation among PVC constitutive elements and potential stakeholders' expected benefits. Such a theoretical approach leads to the identification of PVC typologies, which would optimally integrate themselves in business ecosystems, while ensuring member's motivation, commitment and welfare. The characterization of an emerging Professional Virtual Community, ESoCE-Net, is reported as a first attempt in characterizing a PVC with reference to the newly established conceptual framework. The results reported in this paper are also based on activities carried out within the ECOLEAD IP project, co-funded by the European Commission under the the framework programme.

AB The knowledge-based networked business ecosystem represents geographical (or virtual) area where specific policy initiatives foster growth and improve innovation, productivity and social aspects through the optimal use local assets empowered by information and communication systems (ICT). Effective human interaction with ICT within such a digital ecosystem depends on the access methods, suitability and form of content and knowledge sharing. A network of digital ecosystems, as public common resource, offers to SMEs and to less developed areas opportunities of participation in the global economy.

AB This paper aims at defining the Business Modelling Language main characteristics in the context of the Digital Business Ecosystem Project. One of the main obstacles in the adoption of e-business technologies from organizations and communities depends on the divide between information technologies and methodologies enabling business knowledge modeling. These methodologies are, on one side, not sufficiently connected with software development and management processes and, on the other, poorly usable and understandable by business users. BML main purpose is to allow simple communication among business people and IT system designers through a rule-based and natural language approach, granting at the same time strong expressiveness and formal logic mapping.

DE supply chain management; dominant species; keystone species;

AB In view of the competition between supply chains, many researchers have tried to use the quintessence of life science for reference in their research work. But two very important concepts, dominant species and keystone species in biology are very easily confused in the research of management-bionics. There are a lot of similarities between supply chains in business society and food chains in natural world. So an attempt to distinguish dominant species and keystone species in supply chain management (SCM) is made. In this paper, the enterprises with the same or similar business are defined as a species in SCM. The value chain is adopted as the essential of supply chain. Imitating the general model of energy flow in food chain, the general model of value flow in supply chain is brought forward. The asset in the general model of value flow is analyzed and confirmed as the imitational variable of the biomass. The relative profit is analyzed and confirmed as the imitational variable of the species influence. Imitating the model of distinguishing dominant species and keystone species in biology based on the relationship of the relative biomass and the influence of species, the model of distinguishing these two species in SCM based on the relationship of the relative asset and the relative profit is put forward. The examples also show the benefit of paying more attention to the keystone species in SCM. Recognizing and using these two species in SCM correctly may be helpful for better undestanding of SCM. A new bridge between the future quantitative analysis and the traditional qualitative analysis of studies on management-bionics or business ecosystem is also set up.

SO HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB Microsoft's and Wal-Mart's preeminence in modern business has been attributed to any number of factors-from the vision and drive of their founders to the companies' aggressive competitive practices. But the authors maintain that the success realized by these two very different companies is due only partly to the organizations themselves; a bigger factor is the success of the networks of companies with which Microsoft and Wal-Mart do business.
   Most companies today inhabit ecosystems-loose networks of suppliers, distributors, and outsourcers; makers of related products or services; providers of relevant technology; and other organizations that affect, and are affected by, the creation and delivery of a company's own offering. Despite being increasingly central to modern business, ecosystems are still poorly understood and even more poorly managed. The analogy between business networks and biological ecosystems can aid this understanding by vividly highlighting certain pivotal concepts.
   The moves that a company makes will, to varying degrees, affect the health of its business network, which in turn will ultimately affect the organization's performance-for ill as well as for good. Because a company, like an individual species in a biological ecosystem, ultimately shares its fate with the network as a whole, smart firms pursue strategies that will benefit everyone.
   So how can you promote the health and the stability of your own ecosystem, determine your place in it, and develop a strategy to match your role, thereby helping to ensure your company's well-being? It depends on your role-current and potential-within the network. Is your company a niche player, a keystone, or a dominator? The answer to this question may be different for different parts of your business. It may also change as your ecosystem changes. Knowing what to do requires understanding the ecosystem and your organization's role in it.

AB A European joint project (COSPA) with the participation of eight countries from all parts of Europe studies the application advantages (and drawbacks) of Open Source software (OS) and of Open Data Standards (ODS) in Public Administration (PA). PAs are among the biggest computer- and software consumers world-wide, thus they should be very careful what to use, how to use. PAs spend every year a considerable amount of money for commercial off-the-shelf software licenses. By using appropriate technologies, such expenses might be either dramatically reduced, or re-routed to further develop local business ecosystems. This project aims at introducing, analyzing, and supporting the use of ODS and OS software for personal productivity and document management in European PAs.

AB With the development of Internet Economy, Knowledge-based Economy and global competition uncertain dynamic environment become the basic background of discussing and analyzing national/regional/corporation competitive strategy. Strategic management is concerned with how to reduce the risk in a dynamic market, when and how to match the decision-making with chance-windows, how to quickly seize the opportunity and change the competitive situation, and whether or not there is a general framework to follow when an uncertain dynamic competition is coming up. Based on analyzing traditional framework of competitive strategy and building above business ecosystems study, this paper presented a general framework of analyzing competitive strategy in dynamic infinite competitive environment. Identifying value notion and key driven factor is the core of the new model and also it is the precondition to form a business ecosystem. Successful business ecosystem relies on the mechanism of value-creating and value-shared, encourages support, driven factors and the entry of assistant driven factors. Hardcore firms of the system have to regroup and rebuild the members according to the change of value notion and the shift of key driven factor.

AB In the future scenarios of evolving business networks, enterprises will transform themselves into better forms by becoming "more intelligent". "Intelligent" means ability of a network or company to react and adapt to changing market opportunities and conditions. Consequently, a fast and easy docking and quick formation of network entities or new business partners providing needed competencies is vital. In this paper we propose all ontology-based methodology (ODAMY) allowing flexible ontology-based partner integration into existing or evolving business networks. On the basis of an empirical model describing key criteria for successful partner integration, we show how ontologies can be applied to support a fast, on demand integration of required resources. ODAMY will be outlined facilitating partner fit and matching seen as crucial functionalities in future dynamic business ecosystems. Our approach is presented using examples and ODAMY is introduced applying ontologies. ODAMY allows accessing and providing information in machine understandable form.

AB In this paper we present an ontology based approach for dynamic integration of business partners on demand ODAMY, an ontology-based methodology, is proposed allowing flexible partner integration on demand into existing or evolving dynamic business networks. The approach chosen takes focus on the "softer" but important strategic aspects to measure the strategic fit to discover and select business partners. It provides required mechanisms and methods to support trust building by supporting communication and increases transparency within the network. Network companies are represented by a kind of "fingerprint" describing their co-operation ability and requirements. First, the paper introduces into the scenario of dynamic business ecosystems. Then developments, trends and requirements of existing b2b integration concepts are discussed ODAMY is described and the implementation is depicted to demonstrate how the methodology is put into practice.

AB In this paper we address partner fit in virtual organizations and propose an ontology-based framework for partner integration. The ability to integrate dynamically on demand new partners into a existing value creation network is seen as a crucial ability and success factor for business networks. An ontology-based methodology (ODAMY) will be outlined and facilitating partner fit and matching as crucial functionalities in future dynamic business ecosystems will be demonstrated. The paper will outline the overall process from knowledge acquisition to exploration of knowledge by the network entities and management. The development of the methodology and implementation is realized based on available and proven technologies, tools and applications from KAON project. A reference ontology for virtual organizations is developed and modelled based on an elaborated empirical model. The assessed profiles of network entities are represented by instances. Our methodology allows to query for the best fitting partner in the network and to validate them with regard to partner fit to ensure a high quality of partners. Our derived ontology modelling, querying and "matching" methodology (ODAMY) is outlined and the basic functionality using the powerful KAON as implementation platform is shown.

AB The paper is concerned with a new methodology for analysis & design of Virtual Enterprise (VE) as adaptive complex system (CAS). VE could be analysed as a metasystem integrating a set of socio-technological-economical (STE) hypersystems. It means that as many as necessary geographically dispersed enterprises (large, SME, muES) are doing collaborative business & work within e-business ecosystems (e-BES). This system of systems (SOS) is interconnecting a virtual community by the support of open system architecture network of e-platforms in order to face successfully a high dynamic business opportunity, captured from global e-Economy [Camarinha-Matos, 2002]. The scientific experience accumulated by University POLITEITNICA of Bucharest during the 6 years of CE-Net IST's projects has supported us to develop a university pilot FABRICATOR [Stanescu, 2002] to experiencing on concurrent enterprising, consolidated by e-Learning platform [Dumitrache, 2002].

AB With the development of the economy and IT, the tendency to form network of the modem enterprise appears to be inevitable, but evolving into business ecosystem from it is an option to facilitate to keep the core competence of the manufacture enterprise. This paper starts the analysis with the competence advantage theory, and presents the concept of value net and business ecosystem based on the manufacture network organization. And this paper introduces the general peculiarities, and points out that the business ecosystem is more comfortable to support the enterprise than network organization. Also, this paper analyses the means of enterprise with different competence, The paper creates a view of enterpriser network organization by ecology system, and wants to achieve a harmonious and balanced competence environment, evolving together and forming a benign business ecosystem. This paper provides the enterprise a guide to practise globalisation strategy.

AB Despite the high level of interest in the role of governments in building national information infrastructure (NII) as a source of competitive advantage, it is still not clear how major information technology initiatives can help leverage national economies into the global marketplace. In light of the recent rollout of one of the world's largest electronic commerce initiatives, we examine the role of private-public partnerships in the success of such initiative in Hong Kong. Furthermore, we trace the 3 stages of the project-development, implementation, and competitive entrenchment-to identify the difficulties and challenges encountered and how these were overcome. By drawing some comparisons with the Singapore approach, we identify the kind of government involvement appropriate to spur on national competitiveness. We show that in building the NII, the dual aspects of private-sector leadership and government involvement are mutually reinforcing. Government intervention is necessary in creating the initial supply push, whereas the demand pull engendered by the market is critical for lever-aging the NII as a platform for national competitiveness. The ramification of the study for other countries is discussed.

TI PREDATORS AND PREY - A NEW ECOLOGY OF COMPETITION
SO HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB Much has been written about networks, strategic alliances, and virtual organizations. Yet these currently popular frameworks provide little systematic assistance when it comes to out-innovating the competition. That's because most managers still view the problem in the old way: companies go head-to-head in an industry, battling for market share.
   James Moore sets up a new metaphor for competition drawn from the study of biology and social systems. He suggests that a company be viewed not as a member of a single industry but as a part of a business ecosystem that crosses a variety of industries. In a business ecosystem, companies ''co-evolve'' around a new innovation, working cooperatively and competitively to support new products and satisfy customer needs. Apple Computer, for example, leads an ecosystem that covers personal computers, consumer electronics, information, and communications.
   In any larger business environment, several ecosystems may vie for survival and dominance, such as the IBM and Apple ecosystems in personal computers or Wal-Mart and K mart in discount retailing. In fact, it's largely competition among business ecosystems, not individual companies, that's fueling today's industrial transformation. Managers can't afford to ignore the birth of new ecosystems or the competition among those that already exist.
   Whether that means investing in the right new technology, signing on suppliers to expand a growing business, developing crucial elements of value to maintain leadership, or incorporating new innovations to fend off obsolescence, executives must understand the evolutionary stages all business ecosystems go through and, more important, how to direct those changes.
